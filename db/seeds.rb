To facilitate your learning, this class combines lectures and discussions of the assigned materials. The assigned cases serve as a basis of class discussion and provide a challenging test of your understanding of the topic. They are based on corporate financial statements and illustrate the issues associated with various accounting methods and the manner in which the related information is disclosed. Additionally, these cases demonstrate the real world magnitudes of income and balance sheet differences under alternative accounting methods, as well as a variety of financial reporting practices.\nThis course prepares students for more advanced finance and financial statement analysis courses.

Appreciate how, where and why managers may choose to manipulate accounting numbers, and how you can invert such earnings management.\n[2] PELL analysis. Scrutinize firm performance by calculating, evaluating and critiquing profitability, efficiency, liquidity, and leverage (PELL) ratios.\n[3] Credit risk analysis. Both quantitatively and qualitatively, measure and analyze a company’s creditworthiness and its proximity to financial distress.\n[4] Revenue, Expense, Asset, and Liability analysis. Discern the connections between key line items in firms’ P&Ls, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and statements of shareholder equity and their business strategies, decisions and performance.\n[5] Intangibles analysis and M&A analysis. Gain insights into the economic characteristics, risks and returns of intangible assets and M&A activities, and appreciate when, how and why financial statements capture vs. distort the true economics of these important areas.\n[6] Forecasting financial statements. Learn to construct forecasted financial statements and arrive at good answers to financing, investing or valuation questions. Know how to avoid the errors and dubious judgments Wall Street analysts often make when they forecast future financials.\n[7] Valuing a firm and its equity. Learn to use multiples, DCF and residual income and arrive at economically sensible valuations of firm value and equity value. Recognize and avoid the errors and dubious judgments Wall Street analysts make when they value firms.\nIn each 3-hour class we will combine interactive lecture with applied casework. In the 2nd half of class, I will go through a key topic area of financial statement analysis (FSA) and teach you tools you can use to skillfully analyze that area.

This course serves as a recommended pre-requisite for most of the advanced business environment courses.\nSpecifically, in this course, we will analyze both short-run fluctuations and the long-run growth of the aggregate economy. Topics include: an analysis of the sources of volatility in aggregate demand components (consumption, investment and the foreign sector); the determination of inflation, unemployment, interest rates and exchange rates; the implementation and effects of monetary and fiscal policies; and the role of technology in economic growth. Throughout the course we tackle a variety of policy questions and discuss how they relate to the broader business environment. In particular, we will address: the cause of the persistent decline in employment rates within the U.S. during the last decade, the impact of minimum wage laws, immigration policy, social security reform, the pros and cons of recent Federal Reserve Policy, the causes and consequences of inequality, Federal and State fiscal deficits, the role of taxes in affecting household labor supply, and why the European Monetary Union is more fragile than the U.S. Monetary Union (across U.S. states). Throughout, we will focus on the extent to which government policy can or should affect macroeconomic outcomes."},

This course will provide a broader understanding of these ideas: why they were revolutionary, and how they have evolved and are being applied to modern problems. We will consider how core ideas in economics – such as those involving decision-making; innovation and growth; markets and trade; the links between economics and other fields; and the contribution of all these to people’s well being – have developed and been improved to help explain the world we live in.\nWe will start with Adam Smith and then the Marginal Revolution (which helped to modernize theories of value). We will then look at how economists learned to understand growth, including the crucial role of innovation. We will next examine breakthroughs that allowed economists to connect basic economic forces and outcomes to the implications for peoples’ well being. In the first three weeks, we will also devote a portion of each class to walking through the evolution of ideas about international trade, from the comparative advantage of nations to the implications for individual firms.\nIn the final two weeks we will look at some of the important revolutions in ideas that occurred at the intersection of economics and other fields, such as sociology, psychology, history and law. Nobel laureates from Chicago – Becker, Coase, Fogel – played crucial roles in these revolutions. This portion of the course will include a look at how crucial institutions are to shaping economic outcomes, and – to the extent time allows – will touch on the roles of game theory and lab experiments in improving modern economics.

Most courses in the MBA curriculum focus on the market component: they study firms’ interactions with customers, suppliers, and alliance partners in the form of mutually beneficial exchanges transacted in markets. In contrast, this course focuses on the non-market component. For example, businesses need to cope with laws and regulations, lobby for favorable legislation, ensure access to foreign markets, and deal with media coverage and activist pressures, to name just a few. Successful managers need to formulate strategies for their firms that take into account not only the market but also the regulatory, legal, political and social (e.g. non-market) environments in which they operate.\nMarkets and the non-market environment have become increasingly interrelated: regulation, laws, media coverage and activist organization pressures directly affect firms’ market performance. Conversely, the profit-maximizing activities of firms often give rise to issues that involve governments and the public. For example, the market strategies of some e-commerce firms have sparked debates ranging from intellectual property protection to privacy; recent development in the fast-food industry and financial markets have triggered intense discussions about new information disclosure and consumer protection rules.\nThe main purpose of this course is to better understand the non-market environment, and discuss firms’ strategies in light of regulatory, legal, political and social constraints that they face. We will discuss the rationales for economic regulation and describe the main tools of economic regulation (such as the industry conduct regulation of natural monopolies and industrial structure regulation imposed by antitrust laws). We also discuss firms’ strategies in light of environmental, safety, or intellectual property concerns.\nA common thread throughout this course is that we will recognize that firms can also shape their non-market environment. In particular, we will discuss firms’ lobbying strategies and use tools from political science to guide our understanding of the lawmaking and rulemaking process. We will also discuss why and how firms may decide to self-regulate in response to activist or media pressures."},

Currently, and in the years to come, workplace topics of privacy, discrimination, and diversity will continue to grow in importance, necessitating entrepreneurs and managers who are fine-tuned to the nuances of employment law.\nAll students who intend to run their own startup business or who plan to serve in a consultant or management capacity at a small to large company will find this course essential to operating a successful enterprise in the 21st century and avoiding costly litigation in the employment law arena. This course will explore and debate real-life cases of employment law, some of which are pulled straight from the headlines, such as the Fox News and CNN sexual harassment, race, gender and age discrimination cases, the Uber cases (where drivers nationwide have attempted to be reclassified as employees instead of as independent contractors), the Hooter’s case (sex discrimination case filed by men for gender discrimination), Abercrombie & Fitch case (where a woman claimed religious discrimination due to the company’s prohibition of head coverings forbidding her hijab), the new overtime laws and regulations, Ban the Box Laws (dealing with background checks of protected employees), Sarbanes-Oxley (whistleblower cases), overtime issues, and the new EEOC regulations on employer wellness programs.\nInitially, the goal will be to have the students identify potential employment issues—many of which are counterintuitive. Thereafter, we will discuss the practical implications and applications of the various laws in the employment setting, such as: interviewing; disciplining; firing; providing performance reviews; documenting claims; investigating claims; and workplace issues involving discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and compliance with all employment and wage/hour laws.\nThis course will explore legal and ethical employment issues, including: To what extent is employee privacy protected? When does differential action based on gender, religion, race, national origin, citizenship, sexual orientation, disability, obesity, genetic information, or age constitute discrimination? In states where marijuana is legal how does this impact a company’s drug testing and drug free rules? Are workers to be classified as employees or independent contractors? When does overtime apply (exempt vs. non-exempt employee)? Under what circumstances are employees entitled to leaves of absence for FMLA, disabilities, workers compensation, and military service? Must maternity and paternity leave be an equal amount of time?\nPast students have found this Socratic, discussion-centric class to be lively, engaging, intellectually stimulating, and, most importantly, practical in its application to the workplace.\""},

We analyze whether various regulatory reform proposals are likely to enhance or reduce the stability and soundness of the financial markets and the economy, drawing on examples from the recent and historical crises worldwide.\nThe second half of the class builds on the understanding of the banking system from the first half to investigate the macroeconomic consequences of Central Bank activities. Topics include how the Federal Reserve and banks create money, how the Fed intervenes in securities markets and attempts to affect interest rates, the impact of Fed policy on inflation and the boom-and-bust cycle, and the causes and consequences of inflation and deflation. In particular, we study the response to the crisis by the Fed and central banks around the globe and the exit strategies from extraordinary monetary policy. We also evaluate what the Central Bank should or should not do and the political pressures it faces in its decision-making process."},

It can also subject companies to negative publicity or political pressure, which affects both how they are regulated and how well they attract employees, customers and partners. So business leaders are often called upon to make credible and persuasive arguments defending their products, their firms, their industries, or the capitalist system in which they operate.\nDoing this effectively – in a variety of settings – is an essential aspect of business leadership, given the extensive influence of government rules, pressure groups and the media on modern business. This is especially true now, when so many people are raising questions about the role of capitalism itself.\nStudents in this course will gain experience forming and articulating coherent arguments about the ethics and role of business, by relating their own views to important ideas about business and capitalism and then working to ground them in clear thinking and informed ethical reasoning. We will use this approach to consider a broad range of tradeoffs and controversies that business leaders often confront.\nArriving at informed views that reflect your beliefs is essential to handling these tradeoffs and controversies effectively, and in ways you can feel good about. It is also only part of the challenge in modern business. Managers must also handle criticism from groups who might gain something by weakening a firm or industry’s reputation, or by questioning the legitimacy of the marketplace in which businesses operate. Critics can include rival firms, politicians, workers, pressure groups, journalists, customers and suppliers.\nThe quality and accuracy of these groups’ arguments vary, but usually include assertions that a business or its leaders are behaving unethically or lack legitimacy. The ability to respond to these claims, and counter them effectively when the facts and arguments are on your side, is a crucial management skill. This is easier to do when you can think through how your assessments relate to broader ideas about business and capitalism."},

The impact of financing frictions on the macroeconomic transmission mechanism and on the asset markets will be considered. Also the impact of uncertainty is analyzed through the lens of recent literatures on ambiguity aversion and concerns for robustness. The class explores emerging literatures designed to confront empirical challenges and quantitative predictions. For the second part of the class students are required to attend lectures by outside scholars: Violante, Piazzessi, Primiceri and Bloom on a variety of important topics in macroeconomics. Each will give one lecture to a broad audience of graduate students and some faculty. Students are asked to write short essays (say referee reports) on two papers that are prominently referenced in these lectures."},

Recent increases in computational power and the availability of \"big data\" have been transformational in empirical macroeconomics. The use of micro data provides additional discipline on macroeconomic models and often leads to insights or conclusions that differ from analysis using aggregate data alone. In this course, we will build the computational tools necessary to bring micro data to heterogeneous agent macro models. The first half of the course will focus mainly on topics related to households while the second half will focus mainly on topics related to firm behavior. Some particular applications include risk sharing and insurance, the welfare costs of business cycles, the role of transaction costs and lumpy adjustment, the effects of economic stimulus, the aggregate implications of volatility/uncertainty and understanding the aggregate dynamics of consumer durables, inflation and investment. Students must develop an empirical research project as part of the course requirements."},

The course is motivated by increases in both the supply of and demand for private equity. On the supply side, the amount of private equity under management - by partnerships investing in venture capital, growth equity, leveraged buyouts, distressed companies, etc. - has increased substantially in the last two decades. On the demand side, an increasing number of MBAs and others are interested in starting and managing their own businesses. The supply and demand for funds have also grown substantially outside of the U.S.\nThe primary objective of the course is to provide an understanding of the concepts and institutions involved in entrepreneurial finance and private equity markets. To do this, the course has been designed to be broad and comprehensive. We will explore private equity from a number of perspectives, beginning with the entrepreneur/issuer, moving to the private equity - venture capital and leveraged buyout - partnerships, and finishing with investors in private equity partnerships. For each class meeting, study questions will be assigned concerning a case study. We will discuss these questions and the material in the case for most of the class period. Before each case discussion, each student will be required to submit a memorandum (up to two pages) of analysis and recommendations. Group work is encouraged, but not required on these short memoranda. Memoranda with up to three names on them are acceptable. We will use journal articles and some lectures to supplement and enhance the case discussions. All required cases and supplementary readings will be posted online in Canvas.\nPreassignment: Students are responsible for a memorandum for each case we discuss in the first class. The first class assignment is detailed in Canvas. All students (including those who are not registered, but are trying to add the course) must attend and prepare the first week.

Throughout the quarter, students learn how to effectively evaluate and communicate the fundamentals of novel business opportunities. More than a collection of tools and frameworks, this course teaches a comprehensive approach that can be efficiently applied across a broad range of businesses. This approach is built (and tested) incrementally over time using a mixture of case discussions, guest lectures, and hands-on assignments.\nThis course requires a high level of individual investment, group coordination, and professionalism. Students form teams at the beginning of the course and, each week, these teams evaluate new venture opportunities. These weekly group assignments require students to look beyond the modest case materials provided. Students are expected to use primary research (i.e. expert interviews) and secondary research (i.e. published sources) to study the industry and enterprise-level characteristics of the business. Early in the course, students will learn how to distill a new business concept down to its economic drivers, and how to model those economics effectively. In addition, each week two teams are assigned to deliver a presentation on the new ventures under evaluation, and to respond to class questions. Through their presentations, teams solidify their mastery of the topic and strengthen their communication skills, while the rest of the class hones critical listening skills and diplomacy.\nThe case studies used in this course are real investment opportunities, many of which the professor has been involved with as an investor or advisor. The cases cover a broad range of industries including retail, healthcare, energy, hospitality, consumer products, and consumer services. New cases and regular guest speakers from the venture community keep the course material relevant.\nClass discussions will cover foundational analysis, as well as the use of market research in the entrepreneurial environment, \"how to\" build management, utilization of analogs to develop the economic profile of emerging companies, staging and structure of financing over the life of the enterprise, and modification through analysis of the tactics and strategy of functional disciplines when projected outcomes are not achieved and the resulting ramifications on cash usage.\nFor further information on the course outline, course expectations, and other useful information, please refer to the course syllabus.\nAlso, please note that attendance for all ten weeks of the course is very important for your success and for other students' success in this team-based course.

Although primarily taught through a corporate lens, the course will build a toolkit that is valuable for both corporate managers as well as entrepreneurs desiring to deepen their innovation development skills, and entrepreneurs desiring to work with or through corporations for product development and/or exit opportunities.\nThis course starts with the question “Why is innovation so hard for most companies, despite consistently being on the top list of CEO strategic initiatives?” We will unpack this question by exploring and addressing the most common challenges that leaders face executing step-change and disruptive innovation. This course does not attempt to build theoretically perfect innovation structures and systems such as organizational structures and stage-gate processes. Instead, we will focus on building the skills and behaviors required by the leaders working within these systems. The goal of this course is to give students a highly tactical toolkit that they can employ at any level of an organization to be an effective leader of innovation within the constraints and challenges in which they work.\nThe majority of learning will happen experientially through working on self-directed projects and experiments in teams, and through dynamic class debriefs of these experiences. Case studies and guest speakers will also be employed to illustrate and apply course content. Theory and reading will be minimal, however significant time outside of class will be required to complete team assignments and prepare for class discussions.\nBy the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation in user-centered design, skills for navigating barriers to innovation in corporate environments, and a bias for executing innovation through a disruptive growth mindset. Specific learning outcomes include:\n1) Become a stronger innovation practitioner: learn how to identify opportunities for innovation and disruption based on market/customer/user needs, how to translate these opportunities into tangible business ideas through a deep understanding of user-centered design, and how to develop these ideas into viable businesses through rapid product and business model prototyping.\n2) Become an effective manager of innovation: learn how to more effectively navigate the process of innovation and how to build higher performing innovation teams. Alternative models for innovation execution such as corporate venturing will be explored.\n3) Become an inspirational leader of Innovation: Learn how to identify and challenge your own orthodoxies and those of others, how to think more creatively, how to act more entrepreneurially, and how to more effectively communicate with and influence other stakeholders throughout the innovation process.\nNote: Syllabus will be posted prior to start of academic school year."},

These projects will be set up in advance. The anticipated time commitment from students is approximately 6-8 hours per week on the lab project. In addition, there are regular meetings with the professor/coaches for updates and guidance.\nClass time for this course is focused on understanding the theory, tools, and concepts of organizing, managing, governing and growing a social enterprise. When relevant, a contrast is drawn between traditional profit-maximizing firms and social enterprises. Specific topics on the sector will include legal structures, theory of change, impact measurement, mergers and alliances, among others.

The students work with the venture's management under the guidance of the instructor. The clients represent diverse industries including technology, biotech, industrial and consumer based firms. Prior to the first class, students will receive an e-mail with a description of each client and proposed projects and will be asked to submit their top three choices of companies to work with and their resumes to the instructor. The professor will compose the teams by balancing student preferences and their knowledge and skills.\nClass sessions consist of lectures by the instructor on key topics related to small business and new venture success including market research, go-to-market strategies, management, legal issues and financing new ventures through debt, angel capital and venture capital. The course also focuses on project management techniques for small business consulting. In addition, there are several guest speakers including an entrepreneur panel discussion, a venture capitalist and a lawyer discussing new venture legal issues. At the conclusion of the quarter, each team will submit its final recommendations and make a presentation to the client's management team.\nPlease note: because of the University's obligation to the clients and the time involved in the client project, students who elect to register for this course should consider this a commitment. Dropping this class after the first week is strongly discouraged. Part-time students are welcome but this class requires substantial schedule flexibility. Students report spending approximately 8 - 10 hours per week on the projects and must be able to schedule frequent meetings with the client, often during business hours.\nClass limit will be strictly adhered to."},

The program is comprised of (a) an internship and (b) an academic course. Internships are hosted by private equity firms, angel groups, venture capital firms, mezzanine lenders, buyout firms and many other variations. The academic course is designed to equip students with timely practical tools and impart experience from industry veterans with the goal to accelerate the apprenticeship process of those aspiring to work in the private equity and venture capital industries. The course is split into two sections, one that emphasizes private equity and the other venture capital.\nInternship assignments can range widely from evaluating new investment opportunities to working on specific projects for portfolio companies. The students are expected to work 15-20 hours per week for their host firm during their internship. The class also includes assigned work in addition to the time commitment to the internship. Students are discouraged from registering for more than three courses during their internship quarter as a result of this workload. While the course is scheduled for the spring quarter, the internships will sometimes begin in the winter quarter and/or continue beyond the spring quarter.\nThe course is a mix of case discussions, guest speakers, investment committee meetings, simulated board of director negotiations, workshops and lectures. Course material is designed to be topical and immediately useful to the student’s internship. Preparation for classes will involve group work and case preparation in addition to individual exercises. The class also employs self-directed videos and exercises which permits students of varying experience to adjust their learning in preparation for more in-depth class debate.\nGrades are based on host firm evaluations, classroom participation, individual assignments, case write-ups and a final project. The course cannot be taken pass/fail.\nStudents will be selected for the course through a competitive screening/interviewing process, which begins by submitting a resume and a questionnaire by November. The host firms themselves choose which students to take on as interns. All students who secure an internship through the program are required to take the class due to federal laws relating to unpaid internships.\nMore information on the selection process can be found on the Private Equity Lab website."},

At this point, there can be no assurance that these firms will clear all of their internal concerns about their participation; moreover, it is possible that the participating students will be required to sign some form of a non-disclosure agreement.

While business ideas are “a dime a dozen”, finding the right idea is invaluable. In both start-up entrepreneurship and corporate intrapreneurship, pursuing wrong ideas wastes precious time, resources, and energy.\nJust as Laozi stated, “a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,” Entrepreneurial Discovery is a hands-on course led by an industry-proven entrepreneur and investor to demystify Discovery, the initial phase of Booth’s entrepreneurial innovation process. Through active but practical instruction, this course provides impassioned innovators with the tools needed to identify the right business idea and then refine and iterate it into a viable business idea that is relevant, differentiated and sustainable.\nUsing a customer-centric design process, class participants will work in teams to explore real-world opportunities. Each class team will choose their problem space, conduct research, perform user-centered analysis and studies, as well as derive insights from customer interactions. Teams are expected to conceptualize and use stakeholders’ feedback to refine multiple ways to address the needs in their respective problem area. Leveraging these insights, the team will rapidly refine the problem and iterate potential solutions. The course’s final deliverable is for each team to demonstrate a detailed and nuanced understanding of their business idea (with related business model). However, this class does not require that each team develop a viable business plan that should be taken forward. The class goal is to build the foundation upon which a viable business plan can be created. Importantly, understanding why an idea should not be pursued is also a valuable and important learning experience that will be considered a successful outcome of the course.\nLet’s be clear: This is not a passive class! As entrepreneur turned educator and author Steve Blank states, “To turn hypotheses into facts, founders need to get out of the building and test them in front of customers.” As such, our class participants will attend in-class sessions to explore important elements of this process including: problem framing, “needs-finding” research techniques, opportunity identification, prototyping, and customer development. However, students are expected to spend extensive time outside of class conducting research, meeting with stakeholders and actively exploring alternatives while enhancing their business idea through active refinement. This class is a lab because it will require you to constructively identify problems or opportunities worth solving, frame your assumptions, refine your hypothesis with insights from your potential stakeholders and re-frame the opportunity as if you were in a science class. Just as successful entrepreneurs learn from the industry, customers and stakeholders while defining and running their business, you will do the same in this class!\nAdmittance to Entrepreneurial Discovery is by application only. Prospective class participants need to apply to participate. Since real-world problems often cut across multiple disciplines and interest groups, this course draws from a pool of students with a wide range of backgrounds, skills and perspectives with experience in business, technology, design, or product management valued. By the end of the course, you will have acquired reusable business innovation skills and tools to:\ndiscover problem areas worth exploring,\ndiscriminate between strong and weak business ideas,\nrefine possible business ideas by iteratively exploring solutions,\nenhance these ideas with customer and market feedback,\noutline a viable business model on a Business Model Canvas, and\nrapidly test, iterate and execute on your defined business model."},

This is accomplished through hands-on experience, complemented by in-class lectures and discussion. This course offers a unique blend of theoretical and practical experiences, as they relate to emerging energy and cleantech businesses.\nThe energy and cleantech industry is a massive $6.1 trillion industry that is being disrupted by technology, with new companies appearing every day. However, like most entrepreneurial organizations new energy and cleantech companies are often small, quick growing and working in an evolving landscape. Therefore, the toolset required to be successful in this arena is different than traditional corporate management. Teams composed of 3-5 students will work with a local high-growth energy or cleantech company, helping them to develop a commercialize plan for a new technology or business model. Key milestones will include:\nAnalyzing multiple commercialization opportunities to determine the path forward (i.e. which approach has best financial benefits and lowest risk)\nBuilding a business plan or VC pitch deck for the new business\nActual experience with an emerging energy or cleantech company will be augmented with classroom instruction. Classroom lectures and discussions will focus on:\nIssues faced by entrepreneurial organizations as they work to commercialize a technology.\nCore principals and technologies that are shaping the energy and cleantech industry, including the structure of the energy markets and overviews of many major and minor technologies.\nBuilding a toolset to be able to effectively and efficiently develop commercialize plan, solve complex problems, and provide high impact advice.\nIn-class expertise will be augmented by guest lecturers (for examples Click Here).\nTo view projects prior projects Click Here.\nPrior to the first class: Students will receive an e-mail with a description of each client and proposed projects and be asked to submit their top three choices of companies to work with and their resumes to the instructor.

Students will be conducting market assessments and developing go-to-market strategies for particular technological innovations that have been developed by engineering students at MIT and IIT-Bombay.\nWhile Tata Trusts has been working towards improving living conditions for marginalized communities across the country, the urgent requirement of making a significant difference calls for a more rigorous intervention with a self-sustaining model that can be incubated by the Trusts and replicated by others. Booth students will engage in a market assessment to identify where the biggest opportunity lies for social entrepreneurs and will work to evaluate the potential for sustainability and for impact of various technologies.\nThe course begins with a required field visit to India in December 2017 and culminates in the development of a strategic recommendation to be presented to the client team at Tata Trusts via videoconference.\nClass time will be discussion/project-based and will also include faculty and practitioner guest speakers. Sundeep Vira, ’10, coaches the course. This course includes a required trip to India beginning around December 9th, after the conclusion of final exams.

For example, the course covers the basic “Capital Asset Pricing Model” but does not cover several other asset-pricing models that are generally discussed in 35000. Neither does the course delve into the institutional details of various assets or asset markets (such as the markets for derivatives), except as far as these are needed to understand corporate finance issues (for example, some understanding of bond contracts is essential to understand financing issues). More specifically, aside from the necessary asset-pricing background, the course considers criteria for corporate investment decisions (“capital budgeting”) and provides an introduction to corporate valuation. The course also considers the firm’s financing decisions, namely, what securities to issue and how much to pay out in dividends.

Besides standard fixed-coupon bonds, several other types of securities are available for investment and trade, from inflation indexed securities (TIPS) to floating-rate notes, from mortgage backed securities to debt instruments issued by government agencies, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. In addition, a large market of exchange traded and over-the-counter derivative securities is available in order to undertake sophisticated hedging strategies or to adjust the risk/return characteristics of an investment portfolio.\nThis course covers models and techniques that are used to analyze fixed income securities, and their (often embedded) derivatives. By the end of the course, students will learn (i) the basic concepts of fixed income instruments, such as yield curve, forward curve, yield-to-maturity, duration, convexity; (ii) the modern empirical methodologies to describe Treasury bond data, such as \"curve fitting,\" and factor analysis; (iii) effective hedging strategies for fixed income portfolios, such as duration matching, asset-liability management, and factor neutrality; (iv) the advanced properties of bonds, such as their risk/return characteristics and the best predictors to forecast their future returns; (v) modeling techniques used by market participants, such as the models of Vasicek, Cox Ingersoll and Ross, Ho and Lee, Hull and White, Black-Derman-Toy, and Heath-Jarrow-Morton; and, importantly, (vi) how to use these models in practice to value and hedge fixed income products and derivatives, from the traditional securities, such as Bonds, Swaps, Options, Caps and Floors, to the more recent products, such as Inverse Floaters, Range Notes, Mortgage Backed Securities.\nThe key feature of the course is that it strongly emphasizes the applications of these models to value real world fixed income products, and their derivatives, by focusing both on the practical difficulties of applying models to the data, as well as on the necessity to use computers to compute prices. The course, which is analytical in nature , includes many real world Case Studies and Data Analysis to allow students to apply these models to a wide range of fixed income securities as well as to understand their risk and return characteristics.

We will apply these methodologies to several case studies, whose topics range from relative value trades in equity options and fixed income instruments, to the pricing of convertible securities. The course covers advanced models of option pricing and credit risk, including models with stochastic volatility, jumps, stochastic intensity of default, and credit risk. We also cover the numerical methods routinely used in the industry to price derivative securities. Finally, we spend a few classes on the topic of credit risk, focusing on the formal modeling of default probabilities and the valuation of defaultable securities.\nIn a world of increasingly higher sophistication, the valuation of complex derivative securities and the design of arbitrage strategies require the understanding and application of advanced models of option pricing, and their application to real data. This course emphasizes both, and provides students with real world problems to solve.\nMore information is available on the course homepage http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/pietro.veronesi/teaching/BUS35132.htm."},

We begin with an overview of credit markets, the main institutions, and the major players, including credit rating agencies, hedge funds, and broker-dealers. We then discuss the forces that affect corporate and sovereign bond yields, credit spreads, and their decomposition in default probability, recovery, and risk premium. In this part of the course, we also discuss several models that are used by practitioners to evaluate the credit risk of corporations and sovereigns, as well as to determine the credit risk of portfolios of defaultable securities. We cement the theoretical models with a discussion of the empirical evidence related to the risk and return of corporate and sovereign bonds, with some emphasis on both liquidity and risk premia. Finally, we examine the world of credit derivatives markets, their role in the 2008 – 2009 financial crisis, and their uses to mitigate the credit risk of portfolios of credits.\nSeveral case studies will help cement the concepts discussed in lectures and provide further intuition on the methodologies used by practitioners to study credit risk. At the end of the course, students will have a deep understanding of the sources of corporate and sovereign credit risk and the risk-return return characteristics of corporate and sovereign bonds. The use of spreadsheet packages such as Excel is important for solving homework assignments.\nThe course will benefit students who are interested in asset management, banking, investment banking, financial consulting, as well as corporate Treasurers and risk managers."},

The course studies financial institutions, financial crises, and the design of financial contracts. The economic role of various types of debt contracts is one theme. The strategic effect of the bankruptcy and reorganization process is another. The perspective is that of the chief financial officer (CFO), who must choose a source of funds, choosing between issuing securities directly to the public versus borrowing from an intermediary such as a bank or insurance company.\nThe course begins with models of the role of debt contracts and bankruptcy. It then considers in detail the issue of reorganizing firms in financial distress. One focus is on the effects various financial contracts have on the bargaining power of borrowers and of lenders.\nThe role of financial intermediaries in facilitating this reorganization is developed: this is a study of the corporate finance role of banks. The course also studies risk management and hedging policies in firms and banks. It considers the risk management goals that ought to be selected by firms. Several cases examine the restructuring of distressed firms and financial institutions.\nThe course examines consequences of a bank's corporate finance role for its other operations. A related topic is the method by which liquidity is provided by financial markets and by financial institutions. Providing liquidity by offering short-term debt may leave banks exposed to the risk of a financial crisis. We examine recent financial crises, including the Asian debt crisis, the problems of hedge funds in the United States, and the sub-prime mortgage credit crisis of 2007-2010 in this light.\nMore than half of the course is related to bankruptcy and reorganization, but it is not in any sense a bankruptcy law course.

Even in traditionally brick-and-mortar industries, software is performing more and more of the work. And, of course, many companies (especially \"lean startups\") are purely software-based.\nLacking an understanding of how software works and how software is built while working in a software-based world puts you at a disadvantage.\nIn this course, our goal will be to develop an understanding of both of these things. We believe the best way to do that is to just build something yourself, using modern languages and workflows.\nYou will ultimately build a functional prototype of your own app idea. To do this, you will learn the Ruby on Rails web application framework, but our higher-level goals are to:\n1. Understand the general, platform-independent patterns of how applications work.\n2. Communicate more effectively and credibly with developers on our teams.\n3. Develop a builder's eye for problems that can be solved with technology.\n4. Prioritize features more intelligently by developing a better feel for their costs.\n5. Implement a modern software development workflow, from task management to version control to quality assurance to deployment.\n6. Be able to make and test small changes to an application yourself.\n7. Be empowered with a new, powerful, and just plain fun creative outlet\nCourse Format\nThis course is entirely project-driven. We will build a series of applications together in class. We will start with a simple idea and learn just what we need about various technologies (HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails) to make that idea real.\nWe will then build a slightly more complicated idea, and deepen our knowledge of each topic. And then an even more complicated idea. In this way, we will spiral across topics picking up essential, applicable knowledge; what we're not going to do are deep theoretical dives into each topic, one after the other, without ever getting to build real stuff.\nIn addition, you will build your own app idea. During the first few weeks, you will think of a few of your ideas and we'll then, together, select one that matches the scope of the course. This app will be your final project.\nThe process will generally consist of the instructor demonstrating a concept in a tutorial app and then giving the class a challenge to practice it and think up questions. You are strongly encouraged to team up and work together on the challenges.\nExpectations\nThis course is designed for a beginner who has never programmed before. It is our goal to make programming accessible to as many people as possible, and dispel the mystique that surrounds it. It's really possible, with passion and persistence, for a beginner to become productive very quickly with today's tools.\nNote: it's possible, but not always easy. If you have never seen a line of code before, you are going to be learning a lot of new things all at once, and so should plan to spend a significant amount of time. If you already have some programming experience, you may have to spend less time initially while we learn basics; but once we get into Rails, it will likely be all new to you too.\nWhat you can expect from us in return is a lot of support. We know it's a lot, and we're here for you -- one-on-one appointments, review sessions, etc. We all will help each other on the class discussion board. There is no such thing as a dumb question; we're all beginners here, learning together.\nNote: Due to the intensive support requirements and volume of requests, we can’t allow auditors for this course. We have many more sections available starting this year, so please plan ahead and enroll as usual through your program (or Take 3 for alums)."},

We will cover the full range of approaches available, including simulation-based methods and exact methods in the following broad categories: neurodynamic programming/reinforcement learning, gradient estimation, discretization/interpolation, fixed point projection, and math programming. As such, the course is ideal preparation for students in any field of study who are interested in solving dynamic programs that capture real-world features, but are intractable using standard methods.

The structure of the supply networks determines the competitive landscape among firms, and how supply risks impact the production process. Economic and financial markets look much more like networks than anonymous marketplaces. Financial linkages among banks, consumers, and companies also form networks through which funds flow and risks are shared.\nThis course will introduce models and tools for the study of networks. We will first discuss fundamental network models, and an overview of concepts used to describe and measure networks. Then we will focus on network formation models, and analyze both probabilistic models and models of strategic network formation. We will also study network games, and discuss how strategic decision makers interact in networks. We will explore how to identify key agents in networks, and explain the interplay between an agent's network position and her decisions in the context of network games. We will analyze how ideas, opinions, and diseases propagate in networked systems, and introduce mathematical tools useful for characterizing the outcome of such processes. We will cover topics such as opinion dynamics, learning, and contagion in networks.

These decisions include product decisions (creating and launching new products, managing existing products), pricing decisions, channel decisions and promotion decisions. Additionally you will have to decide whether or not to enter a new market. There are two features of this simulation – first, your decisions will be data based, i.e., you will purchase marketing research data and use these data to make your decisions. Second, you will be competing with firms (i.e., groups) in the class. So your performance, as in real markets, will depend not just on your decisions but on those of your competitors.

Contemporary approaches to business emphasize the importance of adopting a customer focus. Marketing, in particular, begins and ends with the consumer—from determining consumer needs to providing post-purchase satisfaction.\nOf course, successful marketing and business strategies depend on a thorough understanding of how people think, and thus the overarching goal of this course is to help you think differently (and better) about how consumers arrive at judgments and choices and how their choices ultimately affect their well-being. You might think that, because you’re a consumer (we all are), your intuitions about the drivers of consumer behavior (including your own) are well-informed, but in fact, your intuitions about this stuff are often inaccurate. To remedy this problem, this course gives students a broad overview of important results from various behavioral sciences (e.g., psychology, marketing, economics) that clarifies how and why people perceive and process information, make decisions, and evaluate stuff the way they do.\nThe greater understanding of consumer psychology provided in this course will help students to develop strategic consumer insights aimed at better meeting people’s needs. Moreover, because this course takes a broad psychological perspective, it highlights novel ideas for grabbing attention, shaping behavior, and changing people’s minds within and outside of traditional marketing contexts. Also, notably, people everywhere (i.e., not only marketers, but almost everybody you know) are trying to influence you all the time. This means that the issues covered in this class are not only of concern to marketing managers, but to you personally, as gaining an understanding of these issues helps you better understand yourself as a target of influence. The premise of the course is that understanding consumer psychology has powerful business and personal implications."},

Data-driven marketing is an approach to implement marketing decisions based on a statistical analysis of big data to improve the profitability of marketing using ROI metrics.\nThe class is designed to provide a broad overview of data-driven marketing techniques. In the first part of the class we study methods to measure store and market level demand using demand models. Applications include base-price optimization, data-driven price discrimination, and promotions management. We also study the measurement of short-run and long-run effects of advertising. In the second part of the class we cover customer relationship management (CRM) and database marketing. We introduce a general framework to implement customer-level targeting using predictive modeling based on customer lifetime value and return on investment (ROI) predictions. We apply this framework to customer development, retention, and acquisition decisions. The final part of the class focuses on digital marketing and how to predict the effectiveness and profitability of display and search advertising.\nThroughout the class we make use of statistical tools, including regression analysis and logistic regression. In particular, all assignments and the take-home final involve practical applications of the concepts covered in class using data and methods implemented in the R statistical computing language."},

The goal of this class is to introduce modern data-driven marketing techniques and train the students as data scientists who can analyze data and make marketing decisions using some of the state-of-the-art tools that are employed in the industry.\nWe will cover a wide range of topics, including demand modeling, the analysis of household-level data, customer relationship management (CRM) and database marketing, and elements of digital marketing. The focus throughout is on predicting the impact of marketing decisions, including pricing, advertising, and customer targeting, on customer profitability and the return on investment (ROI) from a customer interaction.\nThe students will get immersed in a workflow that begins with the initial processing of the raw data and ends with the implementation of the marketing decision. First, we will learn how to manage and process large databases. The tools that we will use include SQL and some key packages in R that are designed for big data processing. Second, we will discuss and apply some modern statistical tools building on regression analysis, including Bayesian hierarchical models and some key tools from the machine learning literature. Finally, we will learn how to implement key marketing decisions based on the statistical analysis of the data.\nNote: The broad set of topics in this class overlaps with the topics covered in 37103 (Data-Driven Marketing).

The primary purpose is to provide marketers with a hands-on experience in developing and interpreting marketing research information to enable more rigor in marketing decision-making and strategy development. The course is structured from the point of view of the marketing executive, product manager, management consultant or entrepreneur who will use research initiatives to understand the beliefs, motivations and reactions of key market constituents and to inform strategy decisions. The new type of strategic marketing required can be referred to as marketing engineering.\nStudents will work in teams to conduct original marketing research and solve real-world marketing challenges for their client companies. In the past, a wide range of companies have participated in marketing labs including large companies such P&G, Google, Starbucks, Symantec, PepsiCo, Intel, and Walmart as well as successful niche companies such as ErgoBaby, Shutterfly, Chamberlain, Accuweather.com, GardenLites and Cacique. Considerable effort is made in the months prior to the start of this lab class to recruit companies and scope projects that are important to the client company while providing a robust and relevant learning experience for students. The course will cover and client projects will require teams to generate both qualitative and quantitative research. The underlying approach is designed to have students pursue marketing initiatives to help a company address business issues such as growing revenues, increasing gross margins, engaging and keeping customers, etc. These marketing initiatives might include identifying the key factors driving changes in the market, segmenting the market to identify target customers, identifying competitive gaps, positioning the company or products, leveraging brand equity, optimizing a product’s features and configuration, testing new product concepts, gaining insights on pricing, informing advertising and messaging, estimating market potential, and the like. The course will help students to develop a critical eye for marketing research and an understanding of how to leverage the right research approach to address a marketing issue to be solved. The emphasis is on applying research tools and templates rather than on learning the statistical underpinnings and formulas that drive data analyses.\nGroup projects will be company-sponsored, real-world marketing projects. Student teams will work closely with their clients, with the guidance of an experienced faculty coach, to uncover market, customer and product insights through qualitative research, obtain strategic & relevant proprietary data through structured quantitative research, develop conclusions from data analysis, and provide actionable recommendations to the marketing challenge(s) faced by the company.

In recent years, technological change, particularly the proliferation of online A/B testing, has fundamentally altered the methods and benefits of marketing experimentation. This course will cover the fundamentals of conducting marketing experiments and students will learn how to incorporate experimental results into managerial decision making. In particular, we will discuss:\n1. The kinds of decisions for which experimental tests are most beneficial compared to alternative approaches.\n2. How to design experiments, taking into account factors including cost, sample size and effective treatment rates, analytic complexity, modeling and decision needs, potential information leakage and other sources of bias, and customer reaction.\n3. How to statistically analyze experimental results to draw valid conclusions that will generalize reliably to the decisions being made.\n4. How to incorporate experimental results into decision making, including differences between tactical and strategic findings, identifying and managing threats to internal and external validity, and incorporating experimentation into long-term knowledge-building.\nThe course will use a combination of lectures, case studies, hands-on exercises and an exam. Students will learn the tools needed to implement experimental methods in practice, from lab and survey-based experiments and concept tests to in-store, online and direct-communication field testing. We will discuss cases in which experimentation changed the way organizations made decisions, drawing on examples from advertising, online sales, consumer packaged-goods, consumer finance, fundraising and government."},

For most companies, the improvement of pricing strategy is one of the main strategic goals and also one of the main strategic challenges. Most companies struggle with the same basic questions. How do we formulate a pricing strategy? Which data and methods should we be using to make pricing decisions? Who should be in charge of pricing decision-making? In practice, most firms use ad hoc rules of thumb that often fail to generate pricing recommendations that are even close to optimal. The simplicity of these rules of thumb comes at a substantial cost to profitability. Most rules fail to align pricing with the perceived value of consumers and their underlying willingness-to-pay. Many firms also struggle with the delegation of pricing responsibility within the organization, exacerbating the use of simple rules of thumb that fail to deliver effective pricing decisions.\nThis course blends marketing analytic frameworks, marketing strategy & microeconomic theory, and data to formulate actionable pricing strategies. Students will learn how to coordinate pricing decisions with the rest of the marketing value proposition. Numerous pricing structures are developed in the course, along with their microeconomic foundations. Students will learn the underlying theory for each pricing structure, along with the practical considerations for implementation.\nThe course combines cases and homework to teach students how to design and execute pricing strategies. Students will be expected to work with different forms of data and corresponding analytic methods. The course will cover pricing strategies across many contexts including services, B2B and international.\nDuring the quarter, there are 4 group homework assignments, 3 group case write-ups and 1 individual case assignment. The individual assignment is due during week 3. If you register late for the course, you must still submit this first assignment in class during week 3. Failure to submit this assignment will result in a grade of zero and no exceptions will be made. Provisional grades can be assigned so long as students complete all the assignments during the quarter.\nFor some of the group homework assignments, you will need to run a regression and/or use optimization software. Two review sessions have been scheduled with one of the course TAs to assist those students who are unfamiliar with these techniques.\nFor the group assignments and group case write-ups, students need to form a group of 4-5 people. All group members must be registered for the same section. No exceptions will be made."},

The framework rests on three important economic concepts: information, incentives and coordination.\nWe will mainly use cases to illustrate how strategies for taking products to market make use of these concepts. Each week, one or two cases are discussed, covering a variety of markets and products. Strategic issues relating to choice of channels, organization, contracting and information flows are emphasized. Many of the cases will address channel conflict, multi-channel coordination, and multi-channel incentives. The cases are complemented with readings that build and expand on key concepts.

Faculty provide students with tools for solving complex problems and detailed feedback regarding their performance. Students who complete this course report they learn a great deal about their abilities as business professionals and find themselves better prepared to manage complex problems and situations in the workplace.\nGuided by faculty coaches who are experienced business professionals, each student group is challenged to solve a client problem as an effective team. In previous years Abbott Labs, Accenture, American Airlines, Ameritrade, Bank of America, BASF, Barclays, Citicorp, Clorox, Dow Chemical, Eli Lilly, Frito-Lay, General Electric, W.W. Grainger, Harman International, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, Kraft, Microsoft, Nabisco, Nestle, Snap-on Tools, and Roche Diagnostics have sponsored real-world projects. Client-sponsors report that the business insights generated by our teams are as good as, and at times even better than, those produced by top tier consulting firms.\nWe work with our client-sponsors to offer two distinct types of projects each year:\nNEW PRODUCT PROJECTS: Clients ask our teams to develop new products and services for consumer or business markets. New product projects can teach students how to generate and evaluate new product concepts, how to develop and test prototypes, how to develop a marketing plan for the new product (including competitive positioning, financial forecasts, distribution plans, packaging, a pricing strategy, and a promotional strategy), and, finally, how to present your results to your client in an effective manner. Note that it is not possible to tackle all of these subjects in a single academic quarter. Project scope will be limited to a subset negotiated by the faculty with the client.\nSTRATEGY PROJECTS: Clients also ask our teams to improve the business performance of existing products, to identify whole new business ventures, to estimate the commercial potential of new technologies, acquisition targets, or targets for divestment. Our strategy projects teach students through direct experience how to decompose a complex strategic problem, how to develop and implement a research plan to evaluate competing solutions, and how to present your selected solutions to your client.\nThe tools and techniques you will use in these labs are widely employed by business consultants and managers, although time will focus the team on the tools required to solve your client's problem. If you are interested in obtaining a broad overview of all the tools consultants and marketers could employ in a variety of situations, we recommend that you supplement this course with other Chicago Booth courses. This course, however, provides an ideal opportunity to acquire practical experience in managing a cross disciplinary team engaged in a strategy or marketing consulting project. Project sponsors and a brief description of the projects are announced via an email sent to all Chicago Booth students prior to the beginning of each quarter. Students do not bid for this course. Rather, as further detailed in the email announcement, interested students apply for the course by submitting their resumes for consideration. Questions regarding the course can be directed to the Management Lab Business Manager at 773/702.0635.

This course is intended to address this development by providing the scientific knowledge of human thought and behavior that is critical for successfully managing others, and also for successfully managing ourselves.\nUsing a combination of lectures, discussions, and group activities, the course offers an introduction to theory and research in the behavioral sciences. Its primary goal is to develop conceptual frameworks that help students to understand and manage effectively their own complicated work settings.\nThe course is organized into two main sections: (1) the individual, and (2) the organization. The first half of the course is concerned with issues related to individual behavior, such as how people’s attitudes influence their actions, how people form impressions of others and attribute causes of behavior, and how the choices people make are influenced by characteristics of the decision-maker and the decision-making process. The second half of the course turns to people’s behavior in the context of a larger enterprise. It addresses how organizations can successfully coordinate the actions of their members.

Whether you’re selling a product, pitching a startup, soliciting donations, trying to shape public policy, or revolutionizing an industry, the ability to persuade others is critical. “Command and control” is usually an illusion. If you want to effect change, you need to overcome skepticism and opposition in order to win minds and alter actions.

Conversely, the most logical, sensible, and rational ideas can fail because they’re expressed poorly and unconvincingly.\nThis course is a highly practical guide to expressing your ideas more persuasively. We’ll take simple techniques for improving and sharpening our arguments, and practice delivering them in a compelling way. In week one, we’ll look at why we need to persuade, the strategy of deciding whom to persuade, and analyze some of the barriers to persuasion. Weeks two and three will focus on how to structure your communication. In week four, we’ll turn to the characteristics of great communication, the process involved in crafting your arguments, and how to build a persuasive presence. In the final session, we’ll talk about how to apply what we’ve learned to the challenges we face as we build our careers.\nYou will have writing and reading assignments every week, and video assignments most weeks. Some will be based on your personal experience, some on case studies written specifically for the course. The final assignment will be an in-depth video exercise. You will also develop a personal persuasion plan which we will use to help you track your progress after the course.

First, \"\"good\"\" in the sense of ethical and honorable, a life led with integrity, dignity, and adherence to high ethical standards in your professional life. Second, \"\"good\"\" in the sense of well-being, a life rich in happiness, meaning, or purpose. If you wanted to increase your odds of living a good life, what would you do? If you wanted to lead an organization that not only did well, but did “good,” how would you lead them? If you wanted to manage a team that also lived a good life, how should you manage them?\nThis is primarily a course about ethics, but it is far from a typical ethics course. We will not spend time discussing ethical dilemmas, or trying to decide what is right or wrong in ethical settings. Instead, we will adopt a psychological approach to understanding ethical behavior. We will try to provide some answers to the most fundamental problem in all of ethics: why do good people sometimes do bad things? Answering this question requires a fundamental understanding of the psychological processes that govern human thought and behavior in ethical domains. It requires understanding the processes underlying moral psychology. These psychological processes can lure anyone—including you and I—into the ethical lapses that ruin careers, destroy businesses, and bring shame to individuals and organizations. Understanding these processes will give you insights into how you would design your life, your organization, and your team so that it not only does well in life, but also lives a good life. We will end this course by discussing what scientists have learned about the other aspect of a good life: wellbeing, happiness, meaning, and purpose. Ethics and hedonics are sometimes described as opposites: either you do good or you feel good, but you don’t do both. The existing empirical evidence on wellbeing demonstrates that this is simply untrue.\nFinally, let me note that this course is an experiment. Existing research on the consequences of teaching business ethics suggests that it may be ineffective. Those who take business ethics classes appear to behave no more ethically than those who do not take such classes. I think this is because the standard business ethics class takes the wrong approach. It tries to teach ethical principles rather than ethical practice. It takes a philosophical or theological approach rather than a data-driven psychological approach. It tries to influence your ethical beliefs rather than trying to help you live by ethical principles that are widely known, believed, and accepted. This course is an attempt to teach ethics, and hedonics, differently. It is part of a growing movement in the world’s major business schools to teach ethics as a psychological problem rather than as a philosophical or theological problem. It is a course designed to give you tools to enable good people, like you and I, to live a good life.\nCourse Format\nThis course will involve a combination of lecture, class discussion, in-class and out-of-class exercises, and occasional case discussion."},

You will be handed a big, ambiguous, messy real-world challenge and asked to identify and tackle a small, manageable chunk of it during the three quarters. This means developing, evolving, and sticking to a project plan, understanding the relevant organizational and user context, diagnosing what is going on from behavioral science perspective, and developing psychologically-informed solutions. One or more of those solutions you’ll further refine into concrete hypotheses to put to the test in a randomized controlled experiment, to ultimately deliver your partner organization with new knowledge, communications, tools or other products to improve their choice architecture. You will be researching, observing, writing, listening, debating, creating, testing, analyzing, and presenting – all to implement a real and valuable change in your partner organization’s world. This is not about creating a report to sit and gather dust on a shelf.\nYour work in this course will primarily be done as a member of one of several small teams. Each team will be paired up with a partner organization that seeks to understand how it can integrate the tools of behavioral science to further a major initiative, and your work to advance that goal will progress from Fall 2016 through Spring 2017. In-class lectures (from faculty as well as guest organization leaders), discussion, and coaching sessions will be scheduled throughout the year to support each team’s schedule of offline project work.\nOverall, this course aims to enhance your understanding and experience with both the benefits and challenges of incorporating behavioral science into the workplace. In so doing, you will gain the insight and skill necessary to be a smarter, more impactful choice architect in your own jobs and lives outside of the classroom."},

The course will be divided into two parts. The first half of the course (led by Jane) will cover current topics related to the psychology of intuitive belief and judgment, including magical thinking and superstition, rituals, stereotyping and automatic inferences, and interventions for improving attitudes and experiences for those in conflict or who have been disadvantaged. The second half (led by Ann) will address four distinct topics in consumer research, an area of study to which many managerial and organizational behavior students ultimately contribute. These topics are anthropomorphism, decision making about food, numerosity, and social influences. The first week on anthropomorphism will involve a short presentation by the professor who has worked in the area.\nThe purpose of this seminar is to stimulate future research, by you, on the course topics. During the first half of the quarter, in each class we will discuss both work conducted by Jane and related work by others. In the second half, we will review recent research on topics of importance in consumer research, which has been examined from different angles and, in some cases, different paradigms. We will examine this work critically to assess present contribution, open questions, and possible avenues of integration."},

This is not about the day-to-day operations of the firm, but about designing the firm for execution, in order to achieve competitive advantage.\nThe first challenge for the executive is to understand the competitive forces in an industry or market. But this is not enough. Some firms in “bad” markets routinely outperform; others in good markets cannot keep up with the competition.\nAnd markets are not static. Changing tastes, new technologies, and fierce competition rapidly change external conditions. Executives must continually evaluate firm design to keep up with changing times – and identify how to change the environment to its advantage. Structure is crucial to this task. Poor design destroys value, while a well-organized firm can create value in seemingly hopeless situations.\nThis course provides tools to assess whether an organization’s strategy is suited to its current environment, and whether is structured to execute its strategy. We also cover how the executive can design the firm to change the environment and create new types of competitive advantage. Lessons are uncovered through case-based analysis."},

A manager’s brilliant ideas about strategy are ultimately worth little if she or he is unable to translate them into actions that both deliver value to customers and enable the firm to capture a portion of the value created. Yet, managers often overemphasize strategy development while giving short shrift to execution.\nIn this course, we will examine the complex role of social organization – the firm’s formal structure, its culture, and the characteristics of the people who work there – in strategy execution. This course provides students with an overarching framework for thinking about the relationship between strategy, the organization and the firm’s environment. Using this framework, students will identify and characterize the strategies and organizational structures of existing firms, assess alignment between strategy and organizational structure, and identify steps a firm could take to increase the likelihood of executing its strategy successfully. We will consider topics such as innovation, mergers/acquisitions, new ventures, and organizational change.\nThe class is primarily case-based and it is heavily focused on class discussion."},

Apply and reinforce tools and frameworks developed elsewhere in the Booth curriculum;\n2. Develop leadership skills and build effectiveness in teams;\n3. Learn a healthcare context deeply through an intensive project experience;\n4. Develop proficiency at presenting data analyses to executive audiences;\n5. Impact real-world healthcare delivery.\nThus, the course will help students develop the skills required to successfully deliver evidence-based management analytics in the real world. Projects will be carefully scoped, and most data will be acquired, before the course begins so that students can make steady progress towards clear, attainable goals. Students will present milestones every two weeks to the instructional team (which consists of the faculty instructor and graduate students who serve as project mentors) and, on occasion, to the entire class. Final presentations will be delivered at hospital sponsor sites to physicians and executives. The course is for students interested in leveraging the academic rigor of data and decision analysis to improve healthcare delivery. It is an excellent course for those interested in careers in or related to the healthcare industry, and business analytics more broadly.\nProject Descriptions for 2017\nInterested students are invited to attend one of two informational sessions during Winter quarter (to be announced).\nThis year’s projects and the course structure will be discussed.\nStudents unable to attend this session are welcome to send questions to labcourses@chicagobooth.edu\nand/or watch a recording of the session (Booth username and password required)."},

Class attendance is strictly limited to 40 students.\nThe course is designed for students that have completed at least one quarter in the MBA program. The course is also suitable for students who plan on taking later on courses in big data and machine learning.\nThere is no mandatory textbook in this course. Course class slides will be available on the course site.\nCourse description\nYou decide to establish a start-up in marketing consulting. You search the Internet and find to your dismay well over 650 companies in that area, each one claiming to be best and unique. In order to compete in this arena you need to have the ability to identify upcoming trends and new problems in the marketing area, AND to be able to provide original, sound, fast and applicable solutions to these problems. One such example that is not dealt by many of the marketing consulting companies is the following shelf-planning problem.\nImagine a customer in a deli store on a Sunday morning intending to buy bagels. There are only two bagels on the shelf. What would you predict the person would do? Hurry up and buy the only remaining bagels before they are gone? Would he consider the two bagels as being the least fresh, touched and left by all former customers, and therefore decide to wait for a fresher batch? As a consultant to the store manager, how would you determine the optimal number of bagels that should be on the shelf at a given time in order to avoid making customers reluctant to buy?\nAs it turns out, the methodology covered by this course, that solves the above-mentioned problem, can also be used for the analysis of customer attrition, sale promotion and more.\nUnlike marketing research, marketing consulting is a problem-solving endeavor that requires a great deal of specificity and is fueled by experience. This course is meant to give future consultants and entrepreneurs important tools and ways of thinking that are relevant for dealing with insightful consulting and are useful in the practice of marketing consulting and beyond.\nThe course addresses a variety of practical consulting problems and their solutions. Some examples are: (1) Optimal shelf-planning (see the bagels example above); (2) Analyzing customer attrition as a process (rather than as an event-driven phenomenon); (3) Prediction of a customer's purchase behavior (buying intentions, buying propensity, etc.) from the customer's patterns of usage of media, life style, political orientation, etc.; (4) Analysis of satisfaction -how to create a VALID satisfaction scale, how to rank products by satisfaction of customers, how to detect easy-to-please customers, etc.; (5) Analysis of brand loyalty -how to measure loyalty, how to determine whether loyalty to certain brands exists, and how to quantify it; (6) Optimizing predictive modeling when financial rewards and penalties exist in regard to correct and incorrect prediction, respectively.\nThe course is taught in a way that emphasizes the interpretation of results rather than computations. Although this course uses statistical reasoning, it is NOT too mathematical in nature. To aid in the analysis, an R-based software containing original and user-friendly statistical programs will be used in this course.\nTeaming up: Students are required to form working teams of up to 3 students per team. Homework assignments are handed-in as one hard copy per team that includes names of all team members."},

On the basis of past experience, students who enjoy 'unconventional' ways of thinking and learning about strategy (which I believe is an inherently open-ended topic) will probably enjoy this class more than those who prefer not to deviate much from a more traditional approach to this subject."},

As a result of our collaboration in developing these courses, we have gathered a large variety of material on approaches, ideas and questions about strategy. Over the years we have also discussed these issues with business executives as well as practitioners from fields outside of business.\nBased on this background and material, we introduced a new course a few years ago. We felt the course was a success and we are offering it again this year. The course brings together a group of about 30 students to meet with us and visitors (business executives and others) to explore some of these issues and ideas in greater depth. The goals of the course will be to develop a better understanding of methods and techniques of strategic thinking and to explore the design, implementation and evaluation of strategy. One important goal is to develop tools and concepts for evaluating strategies both before and after the outcome is known and to seek insights that will improve the process of designing strategy.\nThe course will be developed around reading and presentations (from visitors as well as members of the class) and, as a symposium, class discussion and interaction will be very important. In addition, the course will require a project carried out with two or three others."},

In strategy classes we study the qualitative aspects of strategic investment decisions; in finance classes we learn quantitative methods to value investment projects. In this class, we will develop and apply a variety of tools to achieve greater understanding and sophistication in strategic investment decision-making.\nDiscounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is the basic model for valuing investment projects that is the core of corporate practice and capital budgeting sections of corporate finance classes. This course focuses on ways to use richer modeling tools to improve strategic decision-making. The most important difference in the tools we develop is that they explicitly focus on the uncertainty inherent in strategic investments. Richer models of uncertainty make the underlying assumptions about the evolution of the industry and the firm’s position more transparent, making them a better tool for communication and debate among decision-makers. Explicit models of uncertainty allow one to incorporate the value of flexibility, i.e., real options, into strategic decision-making processes.\nBuilding richer models of uncertainty for valuation and strategic decision-making processes is the focus of the course. We will study different methods for doing this, including scenario analysis, decision trees, binomial lattices, and numerical simulations. We will also consider situations where the environmental uncertainty includes actions of rivals by studying how game theoretic concepts can be incorporated into the models. The key skill that we will work hard to develop through strategy cases and modeling exercises is the ability to take a complex, ambiguous strategic problem and build a tractable model that captures the quantitative implications of the key strategic tradeoffs and most important uncertainties.\nPlease view this video to hear more from Professor Gertner, and learn more about the class.\nFORMAT\nThis course being taught with what is sometimes called a “flipped classroom”; we are doing in class what is typically done at home – working individually and in groups on problems and cases; and doing at home what we typically do in class – listening to lectures – in this case via a collection of videos. The main benefit to this approach is that it will allow you to work on learning the tools and their application with more frequent and richer feedback from me and from your peers than is possible with the traditional approach. In addition, we will be able to discuss the cases in class in order to reach consensus on the strategic issues before working in groups during class to build models that capture the key strategic tradeoffs. The class will meet in Room 140 at Booth 455 a room designed specifically for working in groups as well as sharing work within groups and among groups. This is an experiment but I am confident that this is the best way for you to learn the tools and master their application."},

Students will become sophisticated consumers of media, specifically, of financial and business news media, and will develop an awareness of the far reaching influence of the news media on what they “know,” what they think is important, and the perspective they take on issues, as well as the drivers that influence the for-profit news media.\nThis course explores the relationship between business, regulators, and the media. All businesses face multiple stakeholders: shareholders, customers, employees, activists, NGOs, politicians, and regulators. Their interaction with stakeholders is conducted mainly through the media. Media has a major role in shaping corporate reputation vis-a-vis their stakeholders, regulators, and potential business partners.\nWe begin the course by exploring the relationship between business and regulation and the non-market strategies which businesses employ to influence their regulatory environment. Next, we dive deeper into the business model of the media to see how it affects relationships with corporations, and inspect the media’s resulting influence on politicians, regulators, businesses, voters, and consumers. We conclude the course by exploring particular non-market forces and strategies, such as the role of corporate reputation and crisis management techniques.\nThis course usually features three to four 1.5-hour guest lectures by leading experts in the industry. In the past, students enrolled in this class had the opportunity to learn and engage with more than a dozen guest lecturers, who hold, or held, prominent roles in large corporations in regulation, compliance, government relations, and public relations.\nProvisional grading will be available for non-Booth and joint degree graduating students."},

Many of these stories begin with the importance of good stories and powerful narratives.\nTo help students develop a clearer point of view about the impact of stories in business, we will start by discussing how much of our reality is “real,” and continue by examining the role of stories in our lives, while also identifying the characteristics of good stories and successful storytellers. We will then add the concept of power and how the combination of power and narrative influences political, economic, and business ideas and structures. Next, we will investigate how companies use stories to gain and maintain dominance and look specifically at case studies of companies that mastered storytelling and strategic narratives. We will finish our journey with a debate on the viability of narratives in the current era and discuss how “alternative facts,” “fake news,” and other “post-truth” world phenomena change the way we use stories in business. What is the future of storytelling when so many people call authoritative information sources into question? Is a new method of storytelling required? These are the major questions that will drive the course.\nThis course explains and demonstrates the importance of narratives and storytelling tools in most of the efforts and processes that seek to acquire power and influence—not only within organizations, but very often outside of them—when interacting with customers, competitors, regulators, politicians, and the media."},

Joe’s interest in experiential education started at Chicago when he was a student in one of Professor Davis’ original New Product Laboratory classes.\nStudents have two objectives in this course: to (1) address the complex, strategic business problems brought by clients and develop actionable, data-driven recommendations and (2) to develop their own action and insight skills, both as individuals and as members of a team. In addition to project deliverables, reflection assignments throughout the quarter form the basis of the final grade. (For more on action and insight skills, see “Rethinking Management Education: A View from Chicago” by Harry L. Davis and Robin M. Hogarth.)\nSix team projects will be created from up to 40 students. Each project will center on an important strategic challenge and require students to apply a broad set of concepts and tools. A.T. Kearney will coordinate client participation, supplement faculty with consulting resources to coach and support the student teams, and provide collaboration technologies to enable the teams and clients to work virtually. Previous clients have included 3M, Campbell Soup, Georgia Pacific, Nike, Walgreens, Feeding America, Emerson, IDEX, Avendra, Innerworkings, Valkre, Accretive Health, and Walmart.

In business, we see reputation, branding and public discourage having a growing influence on most corporations vis-à-vis all their stakeholders. In regulation, we notice the significance of media in setting the agenda and influencing the regulator’s reputation, and incentives and ideas. When faced as executives with a news story, a media crisis, a media driven economic or business event, it is crucial to be able to map and understand the players, the incentives, and the dynamics, as well to analyze the non-market forces that influence corporations.\nThis lab course exposes students to live regulatory and media challenges faced by companies and provide them with a set of tools to deal with the media. This course is taught in collaboration with Tusk Ventures, a venture capital company that works with growing startups to help them navigate through governmental, political, and media hurdles. Each group of students will be paired with one of Tusk Ventures’ portfolio startups to create and present a regulatory or media strategic plan, while consistently engaging with the high level of ambiguity surrounding early stage companies. Tusk Ventures will supplement the material taught in class with consulting resources to coach and support the groups. This experience will give the students an opportunity to put into practice some of the skills and strategies that they will learn during the course.\nThe course will feature three to four 1.5-hour guest lectures by leading experts in the industry.

But Tom Doctoroff, renowned author, ex-CEO for J. Walter Thompson Asia Pacific and current Senior Parter for global brand and marketing consultancy Prophet, argues that this frenzy over digital and social media has created a schism in the marketing world that is hindering brands from attaining their true growth potential.\nThe tension between traditional branding and the seemingly unlimited possibilities presented by the advent of \"digital\" branding leads companies to abandon the tried and true aspects of marketing -- consumer insight rooted in human and cultural truths, an enduring brand purposes, creative ideas that invite participation, and customer experience that deepens brand relationships -- for the flash of the new. In Building Global Brands, Doctoroff outlines a framework that truly integrates the two approaches as the best way for any brand to thrive in the future. Using some of the biggest brand names, both American and foreign, as examples, such as Coca-Cola, Nike, and Huawei, he breaks down the essentials of marketing to explain how digital marketing can't stand without the timeless -- or, yes -- traditional foundation."},
