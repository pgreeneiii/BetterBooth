The focus is on the use of financial statements, although this requires some understanding of the process by which financial statements are produced.
We will not limit our study to the financial statements per se. We will also work with supplemental disclosures, which help the analyst to interpret the financial statements and to understand better the economic transactions that gave rise to them. The techniques we will employ will be useful for both equity and credit analysis. Although this course does not cover forecasting or valuation per se, a thorough understanding of financial reporting issues is critical to being able to do a thoughtful financial forecast and valuation. As a result, this course will be especially useful as a prelude to Financial Statement Analysis (B30130).
Topics covered typically include: pro forma financial statements; convertible instruments; EPS; stock-based compensation accounting; accounting for investments; fair value accounting; accounting for income taxes; accounting for pensions and other post-employment benefits; lease accounting; foreign currency translation. Where significant, differences between US GAAP and international standards (IFRS) will be highlighted.

To this end, we will examine the accounting, regulatory, and institutional aspects of a variety of different transaction types. We will pay particular attention to how the global regulatory and institutional environment affects the structure of deals and transactions across borders.
The course will benefit any student who desires to increase their ability to understand and profitably exploit financial information, including (but not limited to), entrepreneurs, consultants, bankers, investors, analysts, corporate managers, marketers, strategists and deal-makers of all types. The hope is that this class will increase your sophistication as a user of financial information by enhancing your ability to penetrate the complexity of intricate organizational architectures and gain deeper insight into an organization’s business model, strategy and performance.
We will employ several different types of valuation models/approaches to investigate the impact and feasibility of different deal structures, accounting choices, operating assumptions, and financing decisions. We will also discuss how incentives shape reporting decisions and the existence of earnings management and fraud in an acquisition- and IPO-specific context. The course will draw on basic valuation concepts and financial statement analysis skills taught in your other classes that we will advance in various ways. First, we will integrate institutional and process-related details into our study of corporate transactions.

Its primary objective is to advance your understanding of how financial reporting can be used in a variety of decisions (e.g., lending and investment decisions) and analyses (e.g., financial distress and bankruptcy prediction). It is applied in nature and stresses the use of actual financial statements. Throughout the course, I draw heavily on real business examples and use cases to illustrate the application of the techniques and tools. Topics include traditional ratio analysis techniques, accounting analysis (i.e., identifying earnings management and accounting quality issues), and financial risk assessment. The second part of the course focuses on equity valuation, e.g., the preparation of pro forma financial statements, and the use of various valuation models.

In the first part of the course, we review the basic tools needed to analyze and value a company – calculating financial statement relations, measuring free cash flows, and developing a financial model. In the second part of the course, we review discounted cash flow valuation model, which includes levering and unlevering the cost of capital (or beta). In the third part of the course, we review market multiple valuation methods. Lastly, in the fourth part of the course, we review specific transactions (LBOs and M&A) and cross-border valuation issues.
While I assume students have a solid background in financial accounting, investments (measuring the equity, debt, preferred stock costs of capital), and corporate finance, I also assume students have little or no practical experience valuation. This is not a good course for students with both academic and practical experience in valuing companies; these students will likely be bored and unhappy because of all of the work required. This is also not a good course for students who completed financial accounting and never wanted to analyze another financial statement, or who do not like using Excel, or who do not like algebra."

By means of interactive lectures and cases, I look forward to covering the following areas of FSA with you:
[1] Accounting analysis & Earnings Management. Appreciate how, where and why managers may choose to manipulate accounting numbers, and how you can invert such earnings management.
[2] PELL analysis. Scrutinize firm performance by calculating, evaluating and critiquing profitability, efficiency, liquidity, and leverage (PELL) ratios.
[3] Credit risk analysis. Both quantitatively and qualitatively, measure and analyze a company’s creditworthiness and its proximity to financial distress.
[4] Revenue, Expense, Asset, and Liability analysis. Discern the connections between key line items in firms’ P&Ls, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and statements of shareholder equity and their business strategies, decisions and performance.
[5] Intangibles analysis and M&A analysis. Gain insights into the economic characteristics, risks and returns of intangible assets and M&A activities, and appreciate when, how and why financial statements capture vs. distort the true economics of these important areas.
[6] Forecasting financial statements. Learn to construct forecasted financial statements and arrive at good answers to financing, investing or valuation questions. Know how to avoid the errors and dubious judgments Wall Street analysts often make when they forecast future financials.
[7] Valuing a firm and its equity. Learn to use multiples, DCF and residual income and arrive at economically sensible valuations of firm value and equity value. Recognize and avoid the errors and dubious judgments Wall Street analysts make when they value firms.
In each 3-hour class we will combine interactive lecture with applied casework. In the 2nd half of class, I will go through a key topic area of financial statement analysis (FSA) and teach you tools you can use to skillfully analyze that area. For example, financial statements can be strategically tilted by management, and you need to know why this happens, how you can recognize when and where it happens, and how to undo the earnings management to better see the firm’s business performance. Then in the 1st half of the next class we will engagingly discuss your answers to the case that you will have prepared since the previous class the week before."

Experiential in nature, the course contains two distinct components: Development (31701) and Implementation (31702).
Development (31701): LEAD facilitators spend the spring quarter developing self awareness and the influencing, presenting, facilitating, coaching and mentoring skills essential to leadership and to their ability to run the LEAD program effectively in the autumn quarter. Within their designated eight-person squad, facilitators select specialties so that they can devise and master the source material to have the depth of understanding necessary to facilitate classroom discussions on key leadership topics. In addition to time in the spring, students should anticipate three meetings of the LEAD Lab in Winter Quarter and some additional summer work.
Implementation (31702): The overarching mission of the course is to deliver an outstanding development program (the LEAD program, Business 31001) in autumn quarter for all the incoming first-year full-time MBA students. The LEAD program (as distinct from the two-quarter LEAD Lab) is the only course that all full-time incoming students take at the Chicago Booth and is run by teams of eight LEAD facilitators. Each facilitator team is responsible for the learning experience of two cohorts. The Implementation phase starts during the Core program and lasts throughout the autumn quarter, ending with the successful recruitment of student facilitators to partake in the following year's LEAD program.
Students do not bid for this course. Interested students apply during winter quarter and undergo an extensive application process from which successful applicants are invited to take part.

In the course, we will study the aggregate behavior of individuals, households, and firms and emphasize why such issues are important for those pursuing careers in business. While this course is designed to serve as an introductory course in macroeconomics, it also expands upon concepts above and beyond what is covered in intermediate undergraduate courses. The more applied focus – particularly to the broad business environment – makes this class of value even to those students who have taken an intermediate macroeconomics course as an undergraduate. This course serves as a recommended pre-requisite for most of the advanced business environment courses.
Specifically, in this course, we will analyze both short-run fluctuations and the long-run growth of the aggregate economy. Topics include: an analysis of the sources of volatility in aggregate demand components (consumption, investment and the foreign sector); the determination of inflation, unemployment, interest rates and exchange rates; the implementation and effects of monetary and fiscal policies; and the role of technology in economic growth. Throughout the course we tackle a variety of policy questions and discuss how they relate to the broader business environment. In particular, we will address: the cause of the persistent decline in employment rates within the U.S. during the last decade, the impact of minimum wage laws, immigration policy, social security reform, the pros and cons of recent Federal Reserve Policy, the causes and consequences of inequality, Federal and State fiscal deficits, the role of taxes in affecting household labor supply, and why the European Monetary Union is more fragile than the U.S. Monetary Union (across U.S. states). Throughout, we will focus on the extent to which government policy can or should affect macroeconomic outcomes."

This course will provide a broader understanding of these ideas: why they were revolutionary, and how they have evolved and are being applied to modern problems. We will consider how core ideas in economics – such as those involving decision-making; innovation and growth; markets and trade; the links between economics and other fields; and the contribution of all these to people’s well being – have developed and been improved to help explain the world we live in.
We will start with Adam Smith and then the Marginal Revolution (which helped to modernize theories of value). We will then look at how economists learned to understand growth, including the crucial role of innovation. We will next examine breakthroughs that allowed economists to connect basic economic forces and outcomes to the implications for peoples’ well being. In the first three weeks, we will also devote a portion of each class to walking through the evolution of ideas about international trade, from the comparative advantage of nations to the implications for individual firms.
In the final two weeks we will look at some of the important revolutions in ideas that occurred at the intersection of economics and other fields, such as sociology, psychology, history and law. Nobel laureates from Chicago – Becker, Coase, Fogel – played crucial roles in these revolutions. This portion of the course will include a look at how crucial institutions are to shaping economic outcomes, and – to the extent time allows – will touch on the roles of game theory and lab experiments in improving modern economics.

48,24,401,2017-11-15 13:22:46 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:26 UTC,"The business environment has both a market and a non-market component. Most courses in the MBA curriculum focus on the market component: they study firms’ interactions with customers, suppliers, and alliance partners in the form of mutually beneficial exchanges transacted in markets. In contrast, this course focuses on the non-market component. For example, businesses need to cope with laws and regulations, lobby for favorable legislation, ensure access to foreign markets, and deal with media coverage and activist pressures, to name just a few. Successful managers need to formulate strategies for their firms that take into account not only the market but also the regulatory, legal, political and social (e.g. non-market) environments in which they operate.
Markets and the non-market environment have become increasingly interrelated: regulation, laws, media coverage and activist organization pressures directly affect firms’ market performance. Conversely, the profit-maximizing activities of firms often give rise to issues that involve governments and the public. For example, the market strategies of some e-commerce firms have sparked debates ranging from intellectual property protection to privacy; recent development in the fast-food industry and financial markets have triggered intense discussions about new information disclosure and consumer protection rules.
The main purpose of this course is to better understand the non-market environment, and discuss firms’ strategies in light of regulatory, legal, political and social constraints that they face. We will discuss the rationales for economic regulation and describe the main tools of economic regulation (such as the industry conduct regulation of natural monopolies and industrial structure regulation imposed by antitrust laws). We also discuss firms’ strategies in light of environmental, safety, or intellectual property concerns.
A common thread throughout this course is that we will recognize that firms can also shape their non-market environment. In particular, we will discuss firms’ lobbying strategies and use tools from political science to guide our understanding of the lawmaking and rulemaking process. We will also discuss why and how firms may decide to self-regulate in response to activist or media pressures."

Currently, and in the years to come, workplace topics of privacy, discrimination, and diversity will continue to grow in importance, necessitating entrepreneurs and managers who are fine-tuned to the nuances of employment law.
All students who intend to run their own startup business or who plan to serve in a consultant or management capacity at a small to large company will find this course essential to operating a successful enterprise in the 21st century and avoiding costly litigation in the employment law arena. This course will explore and debate real-life cases of employment law, some of which are pulled straight from the headlines, such as the Fox News and CNN sexual harassment, race, gender and age discrimination cases, the Uber cases (where drivers nationwide have attempted to be reclassified as employees instead of as independent contractors), the Hooter’s case (sex discrimination case filed by men for gender discrimination), Abercrombie & Fitch case (where a woman claimed religious discrimination due to the company’s prohibition of head coverings forbidding her hijab), the new overtime laws and regulations, Ban the Box Laws (dealing with background checks of protected employees), Sarbanes-Oxley (whistleblower cases), overtime issues, and the new EEOC regulations on employer wellness programs.
Initially, the goal will be to have the students identify potential employment issues—many of which are counterintuitive. Thereafter, we will discuss the practical implications and applications of the various laws in the employment setting, such as: interviewing; disciplining; firing; providing performance reviews; documenting claims; investigating claims; and workplace issues involving discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and compliance with all employment and wage/hour laws.
This course will explore legal and ethical employment issues, including: To what extent is employee privacy protected? When does differential action based on gender, religion, race, national origin, citizenship, sexual orientation, disability, obesity, genetic information, or age constitute discrimination? In states where marijuana is legal how does this impact a company’s drug testing and drug free rules? Are workers to be classified as employees or independent contractors? When does overtime apply (exempt vs. non-exempt employee)? Under what circumstances are employees entitled to leaves of absence for FMLA, disabilities, workers compensation, and military service? Must maternity and paternity leave be an equal amount of time?
Past students have found this Socratic, discussion-centric class to be lively, engaging, intellectually stimulating, and, most importantly, practical in its application to the workplace."""

The first half of the course focuses on how financial innovation and regulatory reform is dramatically changing the role of banks and other intermediaries in the financial system and how the banking and financial system will likely adapt to these reforms in the future. We analyze whether various regulatory reform proposals are likely to enhance or reduce the stability and soundness of the financial markets and the economy, drawing on examples from the recent and historical crises worldwide.
The second half of the class builds on the understanding of the banking system from the first half to investigate the macroeconomic consequences of Central Bank activities. Topics include how the Federal Reserve and banks create money, how the Fed intervenes in securities markets and attempts to affect interest rates, the impact of Fed policy on inflation and the boom-and-bust cycle, and the causes and consequences of inflation and deflation. In particular, we study the response to the crisis by the Fed and central banks around the globe and the exit strategies from extraordinary monetary policy. We also evaluate what the Central Bank should or should not do and the political pressures it faces in its decision-making process."

56,31,396,2017-11-15 13:24:30 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:26 UTC,"The business environment creates ethical choices that can be hard to think through clearly. It can also subject companies to negative publicity or political pressure, which affects both how they are regulated and how well they attract employees, customers and partners. So business leaders are often called upon to make credible and persuasive arguments defending their products, their firms, their industries, or the capitalist system in which they operate.
Doing this effectively – in a variety of settings – is an essential aspect of business leadership, given the extensive influence of government rules, pressure groups and the media on modern business. This is especially true now, when so many people are raising questions about the role of capitalism itself.
Students in this course will gain experience forming and articulating coherent arguments about the ethics and role of business, by relating their own views to important ideas about business and capitalism and then working to ground them in clear thinking and informed ethical reasoning. We will use this approach to consider a broad range of tradeoffs and controversies that business leaders often confront.
Arriving at informed views that reflect your beliefs is essential to handling these tradeoffs and controversies effectively, and in ways you can feel good about. It is also only part of the challenge in modern business. Managers must also handle criticism from groups who might gain something by weakening a firm or industry’s reputation, or by questioning the legitimacy of the marketplace in which businesses operate. Critics can include rival firms, politicians, workers, pressure groups, journalists, customers and suppliers.
The quality and accuracy of these groups’ arguments vary, but usually include assertions that a business or its leaders are behaving unethically or lack legitimacy. The ability to respond to these claims, and counter them effectively when the facts and arguments are on your side, is a crucial management skill. This is easier to do when you can think through how your assessments relate to broader ideas about business and capitalism."

This course uses economic analysis to demystify the debate over globalization. It asks such questions as: Why do countries engage in trade? Are countries in competition with one another, making one a winner and another a loser, or is trade mutually beneficial? Does trade create jobs or destroy jobs? Does trade raise wages and standards of living, or start a race to the bottom? Should governments promote or discourage trade? Does protectionism improve economic performance or detract from it? Are trade agreements such as NAFTA “a disaster” as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders allege? Does the World Trade Organization (WTO) help free trade and promote consumer interests, or infringe on national sovereignty and aid corporate interests? Is a trade deficit inherently good or bad?

Research topics will be chosen by the teams subject to approval by the instructors. There will be several lectures by the instructors and invited guests on energy markets and policy, though most of the class sessions will be devoted to student presentations and seminar-type discussions of work in progress.
Examples of potential topics include:
The future of nuclear power;
Climate policy and the role of geo-engineering;
Prospects and strategies for international cooperation in climate policy;
Policies promoting adaptation to climate change;
Fuel cell and electric vehicles as alternative vehicle platforms;
The role of regulations in preventing or encouraging the deployment of alternative fuels;
Renewable power and the design of the electrical grid;
Energy markets, poverty and economic development;
Fracking and the future of oil and natural gas markets.
The completed white papers, subject to approval by the course instructors, will be published on the website of the Energy Policy Institute at Chicago (EPIC).

We will explore private equity from a number of perspectives, beginning with the entrepreneur/issuer, moving to the private equity - venture capital and leveraged buyout - partnerships, and finishing with investors in private equity partnerships. For each class meeting, study questions will be assigned concerning a case study. We will discuss these questions and the material in the case for most of the class period. Before each case discussion, each student will be required to submit a memorandum (up to two pages) of analysis and recommendations. Group work is encouraged, but not required on these short memoranda. Memoranda with up to three names on them are acceptable. We will use journal articles and some lectures to supplement and enhance the case discussions. All required cases and supplementary readings will be posted online in Canvas.
Preassignment: Students are responsible for a memorandum for each case we discuss in the first class. The first class assignment is detailed in Canvas. All students (including those who are not registered, but are trying to add the course) must attend and prepare the first week. Students who do not attend the first week cannot take the course."

The goal of the course is to familiarize students with the financial and organizational challenges typical of start-up companies; as result, the course is designed to be broad and comprehensive. The course considers startup financing not only from the perspective of financial economics, but also from the perspective of competitive strategy, management, organizations and control.
The course will cover a wide-range of issues including start-up financing, sources of financing (crowdfunding, accelerators, angel investors, venture capital, banks and venture lenders, growth capital), venture evaluation, financial modeling, deal structure, incentive design, valuation, exit (IPO, M&A, secondary markets) and reorganization. Attention is given both to the viewpoint of the entrepreneur seeking financing, and to the viewpoint of the suppliers of capital for entrepreneurial finance. Along the way, we will also cover the concepts and institutions involved in the private equity industry more generally, and how their incentives shape the market for entrepreneurial financing.
The course will make use of case studies and an array of guest lectures to supplement lectures and discussion sessions. The course places specific focus on tools for innovation-driven and high-growth entrepreneurship, as opposed to small business.
Pre-assignment: Students are responsible for preparing a memorandum for each case we discuss in the first class session. These assignments will be detailed in Canvas.

The course is motivated by growth in private capital markets and in the perceived importance of high growth entrepreneurial projects.
The primary goal of the course is to familiarize students with the financial and organizational challenges typical of start-up and growing private companies and to provide an understanding of the concepts and institutions involved in private capital markets. To do this, the course is broad and comprehensive. The course will appeal to students who want to start and manage their own business, who want to work in a start-up, or who want to work in a venture capital or private equity organization.
The course primarily considers the financial economics of entrepreneurial settings, but discussions will also integrate issues from micro and macroeconomics, strategy, organization, and control. We explore the questions raised from many perspectives, often contrasting the positions of entrepreneurs, issuers, and targets with those of managing and limited partners. Issues covered include deal structure, incentive design, valuation of high risk projects, financial management in rapidly growing firms,initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions, and capital restructuring. Among capital suppliers we consider informal risk capital, commercial banks, angel investors, venture capital firms, and investment banks."

The chief objective of the course is to provide an understanding of the criteria for a successful entrepreneurial endeavor and the methods of analysis to make the proper judgment. The casework will consider ventures representing broad sectors of the economy, including telecommunications, healthcare and consumer services. These sectors will be used to examine entrepreneurial activity and analysis. The impact of the Internet as an enhancement to these sectors will be interwoven throughout.
The class analyzes the role of various functional areas e.g., finance, marketing, and strategy, toward achieving success in new ventures.
Daily discussions will cover issues of private equity finance from seed stage through growth equity to recapitalization. Deal structure, incentive design, risk-based valuation, financial management in private, rapidly growing enterprises will be included. Exit strategies will be covered, including initial public offerings, mergers and strategic partnerships. Restructuring poorly performing projects will also be a component.
Attention is also given to analyzing the suppliers of capital, individual investors, venture capitalists, commercial banks, asset-based lenders and investment banks.
Before each class, students will be required to submit a one-or-two page executive summary that includes analysis and recommendations. Group work is encouraged, but not required on these executive summaries. Memoranda with up to three names on them are acceptable.

It is tactical, hands-on, and covers the nuts and bolts of starting a company with a lesser emphasis on investing in entrepreneurial ventures. Students will learn how to raise seed funding, compensate for limited human and financial resources, establish brand values and positioning, secure a strong niche position, determine appropriate sourcing and sales channels, and develop execution plans in sales, marketing, product development and operations. The emphasis is managerial and entrepreneurial, essentially a working model for starting an enterprise.
Paralleling the course content is the YourCo ""game"" in which teams of four to five students simulate building a new venture through the first 18 months of the life of a startup. At the beginning of the class, teams describe a product or service they would like to bring to market, determine the necessary seed funding amount, and outline current staffing and development status. Throughout the quarter, students explore the critical activities required to engage customers, build their product or service, scale operations and build teams. Each week, teams have specific written deliverables for their ""company"" based on the course material. Assignments include identifying key hires, choosing an initial target customer set, executing a marketing campaign, creating a sales pitch, completing a development or production plan, identifying important strategic partners, and determining next round funding requirements. ""Game"" points are awarded based on feasibility of actions, creativity of solutions, and adherence to seed budget constraints. The course content and structure is applicable to all types of businesses. Class projects range from high tech commercialization to retail concepts to small manufacturing firms.
Through class lectures, ""game"" assignments, and real world cases, the course covers such topics as new product innovation; building a start-up management team; identifying target customers; inexpensive promotion/advertising techniques; professionalizing a sales process; and leveraging strategic partners. Emphasis is placed on marketing and sales for new enterprises, because this is a major area of entrepreneurial weakness.
Class limit will be strictly adhered to and adding this class after the first week is strongly discouraged unless all classes have been attended."

Students in this course will have passed through the first round of the College New Venture Challenge, and will be developing their own original new business ideas.
Students may enter the course with ideas that are traditionally for-profit in nature or more socially oriented (either for- or not-for-profit ventures).
Students in this course can expect to learn:
• how to evaluate the potential and viability of their entrepreneurial ideas
• how to conduct research on specific market opportunities
• how to analyze the competitive landscape
• have to evaluate the merits and drawbacks of unique business models
• how to pitch their idea/venture to investors, experts, mentors, and fellow entrepreneurs
Additional topics studied in the class include financial projections, product /technology development, legal issues for startups, and entrepreneurial marketing tactics.
To gain entry to the course, students must prepare and submit original feasibility summaries prior to the application deadline. During the course, students will expand these summaries into full business plans, and will be required to present their ventures multiple times to venture capital investors, entrepreneurs, and startup mentors.
The expectation is that upon completion of the course, some students will pursue the launch of the ventures developed within the class, while others will continue to evolve their concepts. All students, regardless of the steps afterwards, will learn from the experience and challenge of taking entrepreneurial ideas from concept to reality.
Students interested in careers in: startups, technology, business, consulting, and management are encouraged to take this course.
A prize package of seed funding and in-kind services will be awarded to the best plans that move forward. This course is tied to the NVC at Chicago Booth, which has a 21-year history of launching new businesses, and is recognized as a top accelerator program in the country (http://seedrankings.com/).

Throughout the quarter, students learn how to effectively evaluate and communicate the fundamentals of novel business opportunities. More than a collection of tools and frameworks, this course teaches a comprehensive approach that can be efficiently applied across a broad range of businesses. This approach is built (and tested) incrementally over time using a mixture of case discussions, guest lectures, and hands-on assignments.
This course requires a high level of individual investment, group coordination, and professionalism. Students form teams at the beginning of the course and, each week, these teams evaluate new venture opportunities. These weekly group assignments require students to look beyond the modest case materials provided. Students are expected to use primary research (i.e. expert interviews) and secondary research (i.e. published sources) to study the industry and enterprise-level characteristics of the business. Early in the course, students will learn how to distill a new business concept down to its economic drivers, and how to model those economics effectively. In addition, each week two teams are assigned to deliver a presentation on the new ventures under evaluation, and to respond to class questions. Through their presentations, teams solidify their mastery of the topic and strengthen their communication skills, while the rest of the class hones critical listening skills and diplomacy.
The case studies used in this course are real investment opportunities, many of which the professor has been involved with as an investor or advisor. The cases cover a broad range of industries including retail, healthcare, energy, hospitality, consumer products, and consumer services. New cases and regular guest speakers from the venture community keep the course material relevant.
Class discussions will cover foundational analysis, as well as the use of market research in the entrepreneurial environment, ""how to"" build management, utilization of analogs to develop the economic profile of emerging companies, staging and structure of financing over the life of the enterprise, and modification through analysis of the tactics and strategy of functional disciplines when projected outcomes are not achieved and the resulting ramifications on cash usage.

Although primarily taught through a corporate lens, the course will build a toolkit that is valuable for both corporate managers as well as entrepreneurs desiring to deepen their innovation development skills, and entrepreneurs desiring to work with or through corporations for product development and/or exit opportunities.
This course starts with the question “Why is innovation so hard for most companies, despite consistently being on the top list of CEO strategic initiatives?” We will unpack this question by exploring and addressing the most common challenges that leaders face executing step-change and disruptive innovation. This course does not attempt to build theoretically perfect innovation structures and systems such as organizational structures and stage-gate processes. Instead, we will focus on building the skills and behaviors required by the leaders working within these systems. The goal of this course is to give students a highly tactical toolkit that they can employ at any level of an organization to be an effective leader of innovation within the constraints and challenges in which they work.
The majority of learning will happen experientially through working on self-directed projects and experiments in teams, and through dynamic class debriefs of these experiences. Case studies and guest speakers will also be employed to illustrate and apply course content. Theory and reading will be minimal, however significant time outside of class will be required to complete team assignments and prepare for class discussions.
By the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation in user-centered design, skills for navigating barriers to innovation in corporate environments, and a bias for executing innovation through a disruptive growth mindset. Specific learning outcomes include:
1) Become a stronger innovation practitioner: learn how to identify opportunities for innovation and disruption based on market/customer/user needs, how to translate these opportunities into tangible business ideas through a deep understanding of user-centered design, and how to develop these ideas into viable businesses through rapid product and business model prototyping.
2) Become an effective manager of innovation: learn how to more effectively navigate the process of innovation and how to build higher performing innovation teams. Alternative models for innovation execution such as corporate venturing will be explored.
3) Become an inspirational leader of Innovation: Learn how to identify and challenge your own orthodoxies and those of others, how to think more creatively, how to act more entrepreneurially, and how to more effectively communicate with and influence other stakeholders throughout the innovation process.

Often implied in the use of the term social enterprise is an inherent vision to apply business discipline and innovative thinking for the purpose of maximizing social change. This course combines in-class exploration of business models, management trends, governance and growth in the social sector, combined with a unique experience to study the challenges of managing a social organization by working on a specific project in selected social ventures. The in-class and project based learning environments come together by sharing and analyzing the project experience through classroom discussion.
The lab projects are intended to enhance the understanding of the challenges of operating and growing social ventures where ‘profits’ are often sacrificed for mission. A large component of the course will be a group project to assist a local social enterprise, either nonprofit or for-profit, on a specific challenge such as developing or expanding income-earning programs, pricing strategies, organizational development, marketing and branding strategies, etc. Five students in a group will conduct research and make actionable recommendations for their client. These projects will be set up in advance. The anticipated time commitment from students is approximately 6-8 hours per week on the lab project. In addition, there are regular meetings with the professor/coaches for updates and guidance.
Class time for this course is focused on understanding the theory, tools, and concepts of organizing, managing, governing and growing a social enterprise. When relevant, a contrast is drawn between traditional profit-maximizing firms and social enterprises. Specific topics on the sector will include legal structures, theory of change, impact measurement, mergers and alliances, among others. In addition, to insure that projects are rewarding for both the student and the client, some team management skills will be presented. Class sessions will be a mix of cases, exercises, discussions and student presentations."

Selling is a life skill. This course is designed as an adventure of discovery. You will be tested, taught and transformed through a series of lectures, discussions and exercises that are designed to push you out of your comfort zone.
The biggest challenge to growing a successful entrepreneurial venture is selling. Entrepreneurs must build a strong sales pipeline to ensure profitable growth as they tackle other pressing issues like product development, staffing, infrastructure, and financing. In the Entrepreneurial Selling course, you will learn how to acquire and retain customers, use selling skills in different contexts, tell powerful stories, network, manage the entrepreneurial selling process, measure your success and use the key tools required for success in building a company. The course will combine the following elements to create a powerful learning experience for you:
• Frameworks that define and clarify the knowledge, skills and discipline to be successful in selling.
• Toolkit: A list of key tactical sales tools, which we will build tool-by-tool throughout the course.
• Guest Speakers: Real life examples of key class concepts
• Role Plays: Experiential exhibitions to emphasize class concepts. These include cold-calling, a sales presentation, questioning, bartering, and handling objections.
• Discussion: Based on reading, cases, and your experience, the class will be a dialogue that explores both B2B and B2C selling and entrepreneurship issues and concepts.
• Assignments: As described in the “Grading” section of the syllabus, These include cold-calling, bartering, case write-ups, a Story Matrix SM , a Sales Trailer SM and Sales Toolkit for a start-up or early-stage company, and a Sales Meeting with a mock customer.
These elements will be supported by research into both sales and entrepreneurship.
Learning Objectives
You will be able to:
• Understand the key phases of the entrepreneurial selling process, and Identify the most common failure points in the process.
• Construct a sales toolkit for your venture.
• Build a set of sales skills and disciplines that will serve you in any career context (and in life)"

Teams of students will develop an idea for an innovative, startup social organization. They will conduct research to create a detailed plan for its creation and growth and pitch the plan to faculty, social entrepreneurs, domain experts, foundation officers, and philanthropists.
The definition that we will use to determine if an idea belongs in the course is that social organizations are designed, managed and governed to sacrifice profit for mission in a substantial way or to seek funding from investors who are willing to sacrifice returns for mission. Compared to traditional for-profit organizations, such organizations rely in varying degrees on different funding institutions, different governance mechanisms, different ways to measure performance, different marketing, and different HR practices. These organizations may be structured as for-profit or non-profits. Because of these differences in management and the institutional structure supporting them, a distinct curriculum is appropriate, even if the definition excludes many organizations that create substantial social value.
The class will include multiple rounds of pitch presentations with detailed feedback. It will also include a small number of case studies, lectures, and readings about social organizations and related institutions. Topics will include; evaluating a new social enterprise, financing a social startup, managing a social organization, managing and financing growth and measuring performance and social impact. We anticipate awarding $50,000 in prize money for the most promising social ventures.
Enrollment will be by application.

The class will walk through the life cycle of a typical path toward finding and running a business including information on fund formation, raising capital, searching for a company, buying a business, leading that business and then ultimately selling it. Approximately half of the course will go through critical points leading up to buying a business, while the other half will address some of the key issues executives face while running a company (identifying metrics, communicating with a team, interviewing, handling HR issues, etc). Although the main focus will be on buying and running a business, the class is designed to be applicable to many other career paths including private equity, venture capital and entrepreneurship.
The class will utilize cases, assignments and or/ readings in each lecture along with speakers who will give real life techniques that they use to excel in the particular area that the class is structured around.
We hope everyone comes fully prepared for lively discussion and debate. Attendance is mandatory and will be factored into the class participation grade. There will be cold calling to encourage a variety of perspectives and please be prepared for role playing, at any point in the class, as Professors Agnew and O’Connor strongly believe in trying to make some of the concepts as applicable as possible. Grading here will be based primarily on the quality of the ideas with which you bring to class. Most class meetings will have guest speakers as “real life” entrepreneurs and investors are critical to the understanding of class material and frameworks.

This course is designed to apply the Chicago Booth's strong base of theoretical knowledge to the problems and opportunities of new ventures and smaller enterprises. Teams of four or five students work on specific strategic and operational projects for early-stage companies in the Chicago area. The students work with the venture's management under the guidance of the instructor. The clients represent diverse industries including technology, biotech, industrial and consumer based firms. Prior to the first class, students will receive an e-mail with a description of each client and proposed projects and will be asked to submit their top three choices of companies to work with and their resumes to the instructor. The professor will compose the teams by balancing student preferences and their knowledge and skills.
Class sessions consist of lectures by the instructor on key topics related to small business and new venture success including market research, go-to-market strategies, management, legal issues and financing new ventures through debt, angel capital and venture capital. The course also focuses on project management techniques for small business consulting. In addition, there are several guest speakers including an entrepreneur panel discussion, a venture capitalist and a lawyer discussing new venture legal issues. At the conclusion of the quarter, each team will submit its final recommendations and make a presentation to the client's management team.
Please note: because of the University's obligation to the clients and the time involved in the client project, students who elect to register for this course should consider this a commitment. Dropping this class after the first week is strongly discouraged. Part-time students are welcome but this class requires substantial schedule flexibility. Students report spending approximately 8 - 10 hours per week on the projects and must be able to schedule frequent meetings with the client, often during business hours.
Class limit will be strictly adhered to."

The program is comprised of (a) an internship and (b) an academic course. Internships are hosted by private equity firms, angel groups, venture capital firms, mezzanine lenders, buyout firms and many other variations. The academic course is designed to equip students with timely practical tools and impart experience from industry veterans with the goal to accelerate the apprenticeship process of those aspiring to work in the private equity and venture capital industries. The course is split into two sections, one that emphasizes private equity and the other venture capital.
Internship assignments can range widely from evaluating new investment opportunities to working on specific projects for portfolio companies. The students are expected to work 15-20 hours per week for their host firm during their internship. The class also includes assigned work in addition to the time commitment to the internship. Students are discouraged from registering for more than three courses during their internship quarter as a result of this workload. While the course is scheduled for the spring quarter, the internships will sometimes begin in the winter quarter and/or continue beyond the spring quarter.
The course is a mix of case discussions, guest speakers, investment committee meetings, simulated board of director negotiations, workshops and lectures. Course material is designed to be topical and immediately useful to the student’s internship. Preparation for classes will involve group work and case preparation in addition to individual exercises. The class also employs self-directed videos and exercises which permits students of varying experience to adjust their learning in preparation for more in-depth class debate.
Grades are based on host firm evaluations, classroom participation, individual assignments, case write-ups and a final project. The course cannot be taken pass/fail.
Students will be selected for the course through a competitive screening/interviewing process, which begins by submitting a resume and a questionnaire by November. The host firms themselves choose which students to take on as interns. All students who secure an internship through the program are required to take the class due to federal laws relating to unpaid internships.
More information on the selection process can be found on the Private Equity Lab website."

The nature of these transactions and the structure of the class are fluid. However, the essence of the class is that the student team(s) will tackle a new project ? every three-four weeks; each project will conclude with a presentation to one or more senior managers from each of the participating firms – at which point, the teams will receive feedback on the merits of their work. At this point, there can be no assurance that these firms will clear all of their internal concerns about their participation; moreover, it is possible that the participating students will be required to sign some form of a non-disclosure agreement.

While business ideas are “a dime a dozen”, finding the right idea is invaluable. In both start-up entrepreneurship and corporate intrapreneurship, pursuing wrong ideas wastes precious time, resources, and energy.
Just as Laozi stated, “a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,” Entrepreneurial Discovery is a hands-on course led by an industry-proven entrepreneur and investor to demystify Discovery, the initial phase of Booth’s entrepreneurial innovation process. Through active but practical instruction, this course provides impassioned innovators with the tools needed to identify the right business idea and then refine and iterate it into a viable business idea that is relevant, differentiated and sustainable.
Using a customer-centric design process, class participants will work in teams to explore real-world opportunities. Each class team will choose their problem space, conduct research, perform user-centered analysis and studies, as well as derive insights from customer interactions. Teams are expected to conceptualize and use stakeholders’ feedback to refine multiple ways to address the needs in their respective problem area. Leveraging these insights, the team will rapidly refine the problem and iterate potential solutions. The course’s final deliverable is for each team to demonstrate a detailed and nuanced understanding of their business idea (with related business model). However, this class does not require that each team develop a viable business plan that should be taken forward. The class goal is to build the foundation upon which a viable business plan can be created. Importantly, understanding why an idea should not be pursued is also a valuable and important learning experience that will be considered a successful outcome of the course.
Let’s be clear: This is not a passive class! As entrepreneur turned educator and author Steve Blank states, “To turn hypotheses into facts, founders need to get out of the building and test them in front of customers.” As such, our class participants will attend in-class sessions to explore important elements of this process including: problem framing, “needs-finding” research techniques, opportunity identification, prototyping, and customer development. However, students are expected to spend extensive time outside of class conducting research, meeting with stakeholders and actively exploring alternatives while enhancing their business idea through active refinement. This class is a lab because it will require you to constructively identify problems or opportunities worth solving, frame your assumptions, refine your hypothesis with insights from your potential stakeholders and re-frame the opportunity as if you were in a science class. Just as successful entrepreneurs learn from the industry, customers and stakeholders while defining and running their business, you will do the same in this class!
Admittance to Entrepreneurial Discovery is by application only. Prospective class participants need to apply to participate. Since real-world problems often cut across multiple disciplines and interest groups, this course draws from a pool of students with a wide range of backgrounds, skills and perspectives with experience in business, technology, design, or product management valued. By the end of the course, you will have acquired reusable business innovation skills and tools to:
discover problem areas worth exploring,
discriminate between strong and weak business ideas,
refine possible business ideas by iteratively exploring solutions,
enhance these ideas with customer and market feedback,
outline a viable business model on a Business Model Canvas, and
rapidly test, iterate and execute on your defined business model."

This is accomplished through hands-on experience, complemented by in-class lectures and discussion. This course offers a unique blend of theoretical and practical experiences, as they relate to emerging energy and cleantech businesses.
The energy and cleantech industry is a massive $6.1 trillion industry that is being disrupted by technology, with new companies appearing every day. However, like most entrepreneurial organizations new energy and cleantech companies are often small, quick growing and working in an evolving landscape. Therefore, the toolset required to be successful in this arena is different than traditional corporate management. Teams composed of 3-5 students will work with a local high-growth energy or cleantech company, helping them to develop a commercialize plan for a new technology or business model. Key milestones will include:
Analyzing multiple commercialization opportunities to determine the path forward (i.e. which approach has best financial benefits and lowest risk)
Building a business plan or VC pitch deck for the new business
Actual experience with an emerging energy or cleantech company will be augmented with classroom instruction. Classroom lectures and discussions will focus on:
Issues faced by entrepreneurial organizations as they work to commercialize a technology.
Core principals and technologies that are shaping the energy and cleantech industry, including the structure of the energy markets and overviews of many major and minor technologies.
Building a toolset to be able to effectively and efficiently develop commercialize plan, solve complex problems, and provide high impact advice.
In-class expertise will be augmented by guest lecturers (for examples Click Here).
To view projects prior projects Click Here.
Prior to the first class: Students will receive an e-mail with a description of each client and proposed projects and be asked to submit their top three choices of companies to work with and their resumes to the instructor. The professor will compose the teams by balancing student preferences and their knowledge and skills.
Please note: students who elect to register for this course should consider this a commitment. Dropping this class after the first week is strongly discouraged. Part-time students are welcome but this class requires substantial schedule flexibility. Students report spending approximately 7 - 10 hours per week on the projects and must be able to schedule frequent meetings with the client, often during business hours."

It is designed to explore issues of sustainable development, philanthropic efforts and the creation of a social enterprise ecosystem in emerging and developing markets with a focus on India.
This practicum course will primarily be focused on researching and analyzing a sizeable issue framed as a question by the Trusts.
In 2017-2018, the course will focus on the critical issue of water access and quality. Students will be conducting market assessments and developing go-to-market strategies for particular technological innovations that have been developed by engineering students at MIT and IIT-Bombay.
While Tata Trusts has been working towards improving living conditions for marginalized communities across the country, the urgent requirement of making a significant difference calls for a more rigorous intervention with a self-sustaining model that can be incubated by the Trusts and replicated by others. Booth students will engage in a market assessment to identify where the biggest opportunity lies for social entrepreneurs and will work to evaluate the potential for sustainability and for impact of various technologies.
The course begins with a required field visit to India in December 2017 and culminates in the development of a strategic recommendation to be presented to the client team at Tata Trusts via videoconference.
Class time will be discussion/project-based and will also include faculty and practitioner guest speakers. Sundeep Vira, ’10, coaches the course. This course includes a required trip to India beginning around December 9th, after the conclusion of final exams. The class then meets weekly in Chicago during winter quarter and also includes required videoconferences and calls scheduled outside of class time.
As in other Lab courses, expenses will be fully subsidized, including travel. Information about the course will be addressed at the Social Impact Courses Information Session, which will be held on Monday 10/9/17 at 5 PM at Gleacher and Tuesday 10/10/17 at noon at Harper. The session will be recorded for students who cannot attend and the mediasite link will be posted here. Students are required to either attend the information session or view the recording prior to submitting an application for the course."

Most of what one needs to know to understand finance issues in a managerial position is corporate finance, so the course puts somewhat more weight on corporate finance topics than on asset pricing topics. For example, the course covers the basic “Capital Asset Pricing Model” but does not cover several other asset-pricing models that are generally discussed in 35000. Neither does the course delve into the institutional details of various assets or asset markets (such as the markets for derivatives), except as far as these are needed to understand corporate finance issues (for example, some understanding of bond contracts is essential to understand financing issues). More specifically, aside from the necessary asset-pricing background, the course considers criteria for corporate investment decisions (“capital budgeting”) and provides an introduction to corporate valuation. The course also considers the firm’s financing decisions, namely, what securities to issue and how much to pay out in dividends. The format is primarily lecture, but class discussion is strongly encouraged. A detailed syllabus will be posted on the University's Canvas web site for this course as soon as it is available.

We cover both linear instruments, such as forward, futures, and swaps, as well as non-linear instruments such as options and credit derivatives. The use of case studies will help cement the concepts learnt in lectures and practically illustrate the use – and misuse – of financial derivatives in the real world. The course material spans different markets, such as stocks, foreign currencies, interest rates, commodities, and defaultable securities. Applications and case studies include topics related to financial risk management, the dislocation of capital and arbitrage opportunities during the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis, the valuation of customized financial products, the valuation and hedging of corporate securities (such as warrants, corporate bonds and equity), and the study of credit risk and credit derivatives.

The format of the class will typically include: ½ hour interactive discussion of readings and group presentations; 1 hour lecture; plus 1 ½ hour presentation by invited guest speaker, an industry expert on the topic of the week.
Class Format
The class is a virtual Investment Committee. Each student will be expected to perform as they were in the real world in terms of research and preparation and quality/sophistication of questions and insights, as well as challenges to the conclusions or approaches suggested by other members of the Committee. There will be extensive readings for the course, in much the same way as there is information overload in the investment world. The challenge for the student will be to digest/skim all of the materials, develop an understanding of the larger context of the relevant issues, and then identify the critical information. This is a concept based course; there will be no tests based on memorization or derivation of formulae.
The format of the typical class will include a discussion of the weekly paper assignment, a lecture by Professor Small, and a lecture by a guest lecturer who is a prominent industry professional
Guest lecturers in the past have included: Brian Feltzin and Craig Albert (Sheffield – long/short equity), Peter May (Trian – activist investing), Charles Sweat (Magnetar – event driven and structured credit), Bennett Goodman (GSO – credit long/short), Jon Pollock (Elliott – activist investing, distressed, multi-strategy), Brian Taylor (Pine River – relative value, structured credit, fixed income arbitrage), James Ganley (Carval – distressed credit) and Ken Griffin (Citadel – long/short, macro, multi-strategy). It is expected that many of these prominent investors will speak to the class during the Fall 2017 quarter.
ACCESS Program The ACCESS Program will offer approximately 20 students in the class an opportunity to speak with a senior investment professional from a leading hedge fund for 45 – 60 minutes. The focus of these calls may include a discussion of their: career path, perception of the attributes critical to success, assessment of the current market environment, attributes of a successful investor, and recommended reading. Student selected for participation in the ACCESS program will be based on the quality of class participation and weekly Individual Mini-Papers.
Firms that participated in the ACCESS program in the past have included: Anchorage (credit – New York), Blue Mountain (credit – New York), Canyon (credit, event driven – Los Angeles), Citadel (multi-strategy, Chicago), Grosvenor (hedge fund of funds – Chicago), Magnetar (multi-strategy – Evanston), Och-Ziff (multi-strategy – New York), Perry Capital (multi-strategy – New York), Pine River (multi-strategy, Minneapolis), Silver Point (distressed, credit – Greenwich), Secor (TAA, Alpha Strategies – New York).
In order to participate in the ACCESS program, students must also commit to and write a memorandum to the Investment Committee (e.g., all students in the class) describing the call. The format for these memorandae will be described to students invited to participate in this program. These papers will be compiled and shared with all of the students in the class.
While there is no grade or extra credit for participating in the ACCESS program, participating students may substitute the ACCESS program memorandum for one weekly assignment."

Besides standard fixed-coupon bonds, several other types of securities are available for investment and trade, from inflation indexed securities (TIPS) to floating-rate notes, from mortgage backed securities to debt instruments issued by government agencies, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. In addition, a large market of exchange traded and over-the-counter derivative securities is available in order to undertake sophisticated hedging strategies or to adjust the risk/return characteristics of an investment portfolio.
This course covers models and techniques that are used to analyze fixed income securities, and their (often embedded) derivatives. By the end of the course, students will learn (i) the basic concepts of fixed income instruments, such as yield curve, forward curve, yield-to-maturity, duration, convexity; (ii) the modern empirical methodologies to describe Treasury bond data, such as ""curve fitting,"" and factor analysis; (iii) effective hedging strategies for fixed income portfolios, such as duration matching, asset-liability management, and factor neutrality; (iv) the advanced properties of bonds, such as their risk/return characteristics and the best predictors to forecast their future returns; (v) modeling techniques used by market participants, such as the models of Vasicek, Cox Ingersoll and Ross, Ho and Lee, Hull and White, Black-Derman-Toy, and Heath-Jarrow-Morton; and, importantly, (vi) how to use these models in practice to value and hedge fixed income products and derivatives, from the traditional securities, such as Bonds, Swaps, Options, Caps and Floors, to the more recent products, such as Inverse Floaters, Range Notes, Mortgage Backed Securities.
The key feature of the course is that it strongly emphasizes the applications of these models to value real world fixed income products, and their derivatives, by focusing both on the practical difficulties of applying models to the data, as well as on the necessity to use computers to compute prices. The course, which is analytical in nature , includes many real world Case Studies and Data Analysis to allow students to apply these models to a wide range of fixed income securities as well as to understand their risk and return characteristics. More information is available on the course homepage http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/pietro.veronesi/teaching/BUS35130.htm."
112,76,564,2017-11-15 13:38:30 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:29 UTC,"This course covers the analytical and numerical methodologies applied by hedge funds and derivatives trading desks to price complex derivative securities and design arbitrage strategies. We will apply these methodologies to several case studies, whose topics range from relative value trades in equity options and fixed income instruments, to the pricing of convertible securities. The course covers advanced models of option pricing and credit risk, including models with stochastic volatility, jumps, stochastic intensity of default, and credit risk. We also cover the numerical methods routinely used in the industry to price derivative securities. Finally, we spend a few classes on the topic of credit risk, focusing on the formal modeling of default probabilities and the valuation of defaultable securities.
In a world of increasingly higher sophistication, the valuation of complex derivative securities and the design of arbitrage strategies require the understanding and application of advanced models of option pricing, and their application to real data. This course emphasizes both, and provides students with real world problems to solve.

We begin with an overview of credit markets, the main institutions, and the major players, including credit rating agencies, hedge funds, and broker-dealers. We then discuss the forces that affect corporate and sovereign bond yields, credit spreads, and their decomposition in default probability, recovery, and risk premium. In this part of the course, we also discuss several models that are used by practitioners to evaluate the credit risk of corporations and sovereigns, as well as to determine the credit risk of portfolios of defaultable securities. We cement the theoretical models with a discussion of the empirical evidence related to the risk and return of corporate and sovereign bonds, with some emphasis on both liquidity and risk premia. Finally, we examine the world of credit derivatives markets, their role in the 2008 – 2009 financial crisis, and their uses to mitigate the credit risk of portfolios of credits.
Several case studies will help cement the concepts discussed in lectures and provide further intuition on the methodologies used by practitioners to study credit risk. At the end of the course, students will have a deep understanding of the sources of corporate and sovereign credit risk and the risk-return return characteristics of corporate and sovereign bonds. The use of spreadsheet packages such as Excel is important for solving homework assignments.
The course will benefit students who are interested in asset management, banking, investment banking, financial consulting, as well as corporate Treasurers and risk managers."

This course will provide a comprehensive and practical background on corporate finance, with an emphasis placed on practical applications. The course will combine the transaction experience of the instructor with a textbook, academic research, and case studies. This course is ideal for any student who is contemplating or pursuing a career in finance and/or business.
Corporate finance is about making the right investment (internal and acquisitions), valuation, financing, capital structure, shareholder payout, restructuring (divestiture, go private, spin off, etc.) and corporate governance decisions to maximize shareholder value. We will study most of these methods of creating shareholder value. Time permitting, we will also touch on private equity, hedge funds and leveraged buy outs.
The first part of the course will focus on discounting cash flows, discount rates, and the different types of valuation techniques for internal capital projects and acquisitions of companies. These will include the discounted cash flow method, the adjusted present value method, comparable trading multiples analysis and comparable transactions analysis. Then, we'll evaluate how companies elect to return cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. The course will then evaluate a company's choice of capital structure, or the mix of debt and equity on the balance sheet, and we will study aspects of both debt and equity securities. Finally, we will study acquisitions and divestitures and as time permits, private equity, hedge funds and leveraged buy outs.
Course Format: The course will be a mix of lectures, classroom discussion, cases, and articles. We will reference current events in the financial news as much as possible. A mixture of a textbook, academic research, cases and financial press will be used for the reading."

123,80,434,2017-11-15 13:41:06 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:29 UTC,"This is an advanced course in corporate finance. The course studies financial institutions, financial crises, and the design of financial contracts. The economic role of various types of debt contracts is one theme. The strategic effect of the bankruptcy and reorganization process is another. The perspective is that of the chief financial officer (CFO), who must choose a source of funds, choosing between issuing securities directly to the public versus borrowing from an intermediary such as a bank or insurance company.
The course begins with models of the role of debt contracts and bankruptcy. It then considers in detail the issue of reorganizing firms in financial distress. One focus is on the effects various financial contracts have on the bargaining power of borrowers and of lenders.
The role of financial intermediaries in facilitating this reorganization is developed: this is a study of the corporate finance role of banks. The course also studies risk management and hedging policies in firms and banks. It considers the risk management goals that ought to be selected by firms. Several cases examine the restructuring of distressed firms and financial institutions.
The course examines consequences of a bank's corporate finance role for its other operations. A related topic is the method by which liquidity is provided by financial markets and by financial institutions. Providing liquidity by offering short-term debt may leave banks exposed to the risk of a financial crisis. We examine recent financial crises, including the Asian debt crisis, the problems of hedge funds in the United States, and the sub-prime mortgage credit crisis of 2007-2010 in this light.
More than half of the course is related to bankruptcy and reorganization, but it is not in any sense a bankruptcy law course. The course is a mix of concepts (economic models) and applications."

Build a mathematical model to formalize the decision problem: We will learn about Optimization models (linear, nonlinear) - for resource allocation (how to utilize available resources optimally)
Decision tree models - for multiperiod sequential decision making
Simulation models - for risk analysis and incorporating uncertainty in problem parameters.
Analyze model solution: Is the decision fairly robust, or very sensitive to the input parameters of the model ? What is the managerial interpretation of the model solution?
use Microsoft Excel as a platform for model building, solution, and analysis: In addition to standard Excel tools such as Goal Seek and Data Table, we will learn to use important Excel add ons such as Sensitivity Toolkit, Solver, SolverTable, Precision Tree, @RISK, and RiskOptimizer.

Even in traditionally brick-and-mortar industries, software is performing more and more of the work. And, of course, many companies (especially ""lean startups"") are purely software-based.
Lacking an understanding of how software works and how software is built while working in a software-based world puts you at a disadvantage.
In this course, our goal will be to develop an understanding of both of these things. We believe the best way to do that is to just build something yourself, using modern languages and workflows.
You will ultimately build a functional prototype of your own app idea. To do this, you will learn the Ruby on Rails web application framework, but our higher-level goals are to:
1. Understand the general, platform-independent patterns of how applications work.
2. Communicate more effectively and credibly with developers on our teams.
3. Develop a builder's eye for problems that can be solved with technology.
4. Prioritize features more intelligently by developing a better feel for their costs.
5. Implement a modern software development workflow, from task management to version control to quality assurance to deployment.
6. Be able to make and test small changes to an application yourself.
7. Be empowered with a new, powerful, and just plain fun creative outlet
Course Format
This course is entirely project-driven. We will build a series of applications together in class. We will start with a simple idea and learn just what we need about various technologies (HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails) to make that idea real.
We will then build a slightly more complicated idea, and deepen our knowledge of each topic. And then an even more complicated idea. In this way, we will spiral across topics picking up essential, applicable knowledge; what we're not going to do are deep theoretical dives into each topic, one after the other, without ever getting to build real stuff.
In addition, you will build your own app idea. During the first few weeks, you will think of a few of your ideas and we'll then, together, select one that matches the scope of the course. This app will be your final project.
The process will generally consist of the instructor demonstrating a concept in a tutorial app and then giving the class a challenge to practice it and think up questions. You are strongly encouraged to team up and work together on the challenges.
Expectations
This course is designed for a beginner who has never programmed before. It is our goal to make programming accessible to as many people as possible, and dispel the mystique that surrounds it. It's really possible, with passion and persistence, for a beginner to become productive very quickly with today's tools.
Note: it's possible, but not always easy. If you have never seen a line of code before, you are going to be learning a lot of new things all at once, and so should plan to spend a significant amount of time. If you already have some programming experience, you may have to spend less time initially while we learn basics; but once we get into Rails, it will likely be all new to you too.
What you can expect from us in return is a lot of support. We know it's a lot, and we're here for you -- one-on-one appointments, review sessions, etc. We all will help each other on the class discussion board. There is no such thing as a dumb question; we're all beginners here, learning together.
Note: Due to the intensive support requirements and volume of requests, we can’t allow auditors for this course. We have many more sections available starting this year, so please plan ahead and enroll as usual through your program (or Take 3 for alums)."

Students will build a simple, functional prototype of one of their ideas using the Ruby on Rails web application framework, so that they witness the development process firsthand. The objective of the course is for students to be able to answer questions like:
How does the technology we use every day fundamentally operate?
How complicated is X feature? How much time will it take to develop?
What does a developer's workflow look like? How can a manager hook in to it efficiently?
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?
What is the difference between native apps and web apps?
What development work is better kept in-house and what can be contracted?
What are some ways of evaluating developers?
Ultimately, students should be better able to:
Understand the general, platform-independent patterns of how applications work.
Communicate more effectively and credibly with developers on their teams.
Develop a builders eye for problems that can be solved with technology.
Prioritize features more intelligently by developing a better feel for their costs.
Be able to make and test small changes to an application.
Be empowered with a new, powerful, and just plain fun creative outlet.
Schedule:
The course assumes no prior programming experience. However, if you have never seen a line of code before, you should expect to invest significant time in practice.
In return, you will receive a lot of support: in addition to Tuesday lecture, there will be an instructor-led discussion section on Thursday evenings with more hands-on labs, weekly one-on-one appointments with assistants to clarify homeworks and check-in on project progress, as well as in-person and remote office hours.
First class attendance is mandatory."

Dynamic Programming (DP) provides a powerful tool for obtaining structural insight about, as well computing prescriptions for, such decisions. The method finds wide application in operations management, marketing, economics, and finance among other fields. This course is intended to provide a rigorous introduction to the method with an emphasis on applications from these fields. When appropriate, finite or countable state Markovian settings will be used to obtain theoretical results with a minimum of technical fuss. Implementation and computational issues will be discussed."

However, over the last decade or so, researchers have been making significant strides in the area of approximate dynamic programming. A wide range of practical applications have now been successfully explored, in areas ranging from supply chain and distribution management, dynamic pricing and revenue management, marketing/advertising, industrial organization, finance, and others.
In this course, students will learn the state-of-the-art theory and methods for approximate dynamic programming. We will cover the full range of approaches available, including simulation-based methods and exact methods in the following broad categories: neurodynamic programming/reinforcement learning, gradient estimation, discretization/interpolation, fixed point projection, and math programming. As such, the course is ideal preparation for students in any field of study who are interested in solving dynamic programs that capture real-world features, but are intractable using standard methods. Students will implement the various numerical methods learned on a problem of their choosing, ideally coming from their own research."

157,108,414,2017-11-15 13:49:51 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:31 UTC,"Networks are prevalent in our modern society. Social networks capture interactions among friends and colleagues; and shape opinions, tastes, and decisions. Firms interact with the same suppliers and customers and use web-like supply chains. The structure of the supply networks determines the competitive landscape among firms, and how supply risks impact the production process. Economic and financial markets look much more like networks than anonymous marketplaces. Financial linkages among banks, consumers, and companies also form networks through which funds flow and risks are shared.
This course will introduce models and tools for the study of networks. We will first discuss fundamental network models, and an overview of concepts used to describe and measure networks. Then we will focus on network formation models, and analyze both probabilistic models and models of strategic network formation. We will also study network games, and discuss how strategic decision makers interact in networks. We will explore how to identify key agents in networks, and explain the interplay between an agent's network position and her decisions in the context of network games. We will analyze how ideas, opinions, and diseases propagate in networked systems, and introduce mathematical tools useful for characterizing the outcome of such processes. We will cover topics such as opinion dynamics, learning, and contagion in networks. We will see how certain common principles permeate the functioning of diverse networks, and how the same issues related to robustness, fragility, and interlinkages arise in several different types of networks. Throughout the course, we will also discuss various applications and results from the recent networks literature."

Specific course goals include: 1) To introduce you to the fundamentals of modern marketing practice. Specifically, we will look at the four tactical P’s — price, promotion, product, and place (distribution) — through the structural lens of the three C’s — customer, competition, and company. 2) To provide a theoretical basis and data-driven techniques for analyzing the success or failure of marketing actions. 3) To familiarize you with practices that marketing consulting firms typically employee. This class aims to help you sort through jargon, allowing you to make well-informed decisions based on knowing which techniques are applicable given the situation.
This course differentiates itself from other marketing strategy sections by viewing marketing from the perspective of economics. While students are not required to have taken a course in microeconomics (33001 or a course from undergrad), it is highly recommended. We will use demand curves and profit maximization as a jumping off point to understand where and how marketing decisions influence economic calculation."

The first half of the class is spent on building a structured approach using customer analysis (assessing how the firm could provide unique benefits to an attractive target market segment); company analysis (assessing strategic fit based on long-term strategy and core capabilities) and competitor analysis (ascertaining how to build sustainable competitive advantage against both ""current"" and ""future"" competitors). The second half of the class uses the strategic marketing analysis described above to identify issues and challenges the firm faces, and articulate marketing objectives that are used to develop the marketing plan (product development, positioning and product strategy; setting prices to capture value, determining potential channel or places of distribution and promotion & communication strategies to communicate benefits to the target market).
I also try to use multiple pedagogical tools to help students comprehend and assimilate the material. This includes lectures that introduce tools, concepts and frameworks on each topic in the framework followed by a rigorous case analysis to illustrate application. In addition, I will discuss current events, recent industry examples, and ask you to play a real-world data based pricing simulation. I have also been working with firms applying these frameworks for the last 25 years and hope that students will also share their experiences in class discussions. Finally, in order to expose you to different types of marketing careers where concepts taught in this class can be leveraged, I typically invite 1-2 guest speakers from a variety of industries.
I strive to enhance student problem-solving and decision-making abilities and use marketing case studies to provide an opportunity (both written and oral) to help a student develop, present, and defend their own recommendations, and to examine and discuss the recommendations of others critically. Given the rigorous and highly interactive nature of class discussion, as well as framework based approach used, this class is helpful to students for case analysis preparation. Therefore, in addition to students pursuing marketing careers, this class is also helpful to students pursuing consulting careers, developing entrepreneurial businesses, or interested in understanding and analyzing growth and demand strategies of a corporation."

The course develops a common framework (3Cs/4Ps) to analyze real world problems presented in business cases and synthesize recommendations addressing strategic marketing issues. Numerous tools that are used to support the framework are also introduced. Goals of the course include:
1. To introduce marketing strategy and the elements of marketing analysis or business situation analysis: Customer analysis, Company analysis, and Competitor analysis (3Cs).
2. To develop familiarity with the tactical use of elements of the marketing mix - product policy, pricing, promotion, and placement/distribution (4 Ps) – in a manner consistent with marketing analysis and strategy.
3. To integrate elements of the framework prescriptively into real world business situations.
4. To provide an exposure to business case analysis and the critical thinking common in case based business classes.
COURSE FORMAT Approximately half of each class will be devoted to discussion of business cases. The remainder of the classes will be dedicated to the presentation and discussion of theories, concepts, analytical techniques and empirical findings useful in marketing management. Students will work in study groups of 4 to 5 individuals to work on exercises and brief in-class presentations using tools from the lectures. Students will also write-up several cases individually using a format provided in class (write-ups are typically 1 to 2 pages long). Course content includes some light quantitative work."

164,110,421,2017-11-15 13:51:24 UTC,2017-11-26 05:26:41 UTC,"This course covers the same topics as the regular Marketing Strategy class (37000) with two main differences. First, there will be some Excel-based quantitative assignments using the software XLSTAT that will give you hand-on experience with concepts covered in class (segmentation and perceptual maps). The second difference is that we will be using a computer simulation called SABRE in the last 5 weeks of the quarter. In weeks 6 through 10, you will manage a firm with your group and make marketing decisions for your firm. These decisions include product decisions (creating and launching new products, managing existing products), pricing decisions, channel decisions and promotion decisions. Additionally you will have to decide whether or not to enter a new market. There are two features of this simulation – first, your decisions will be data based, i.e., you will purchase marketing research data and use these data to make your decisions. Second, you will be competing with firms (i.e., groups) in the class. So your performance, as in real markets, will depend not just on your decisions but on those of your competitors. The idea is to simulate an experiential component to the class."
165,111,397,2017-11-15 13:51:40 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:32 UTC,"The purpose of this course is to inform future managers, analysts, consultants, and advisors of the psychological processes and biases underlying consumer behavior, with emphasis on how to incorporate such insights into marketing and business strategies. Contemporary approaches to business emphasize the importance of adopting a customer focus. Marketing, in particular, begins and ends with the consumer—from determining consumer needs to providing post-purchase satisfaction.
Of course, successful marketing and business strategies depend on a thorough understanding of how people think, and thus the overarching goal of this course is to help you think differently (and better) about how consumers arrive at judgments and choices and how their choices ultimately affect their well-being. You might think that, because you’re a consumer (we all are), your intuitions about the drivers of consumer behavior (including your own) are well-informed, but in fact, your intuitions about this stuff are often inaccurate. To remedy this problem, this course gives students a broad overview of important results from various behavioral sciences (e.g., psychology, marketing, economics) that clarifies how and why people perceive and process information, make decisions, and evaluate stuff the way they do.
The greater understanding of consumer psychology provided in this course will help students to develop strategic consumer insights aimed at better meeting people’s needs. Moreover, because this course takes a broad psychological perspective, it highlights novel ideas for grabbing attention, shaping behavior, and changing people’s minds within and outside of traditional marketing contexts. Also, notably, people everywhere (i.e., not only marketers, but almost everybody you know) are trying to influence you all the time. This means that the issues covered in this class are not only of concern to marketing managers, but to you personally, as gaining an understanding of these issues helps you better understand yourself as a target of influence. The premise of the course is that understanding consumer psychology has powerful business and personal implications."

Data-driven marketing is an approach to implement marketing decisions based on a statistical analysis of big data to improve the profitability of marketing using ROI metrics.
The class is designed to provide a broad overview of data-driven marketing techniques. In the first part of the class we study methods to measure store and market level demand using demand models. Applications include base-price optimization, data-driven price discrimination, and promotions management. We also study the measurement of short-run and long-run effects of advertising. In the second part of the class we cover customer relationship management (CRM) and database marketing. We introduce a general framework to implement customer-level targeting using predictive modeling based on customer lifetime value and return on investment (ROI) predictions. We apply this framework to customer development, retention, and acquisition decisions. The final part of the class focuses on digital marketing and how to predict the effectiveness and profitability of display and search advertising.
Throughout the class we make use of statistical tools, including regression analysis and logistic regression. In particular, all assignments and the take-home final involve practical applications of the concepts covered in class using data and methods implemented in the R statistical computing language."
167,113,470,2017-11-15 13:52:09 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:32 UTC,"Marketing decisions in the era of big data are increasingly based on a statistical analysis of large amounts of transaction and customer data that provides the basis for profitability and ROI predictions. The goal of this class is to introduce modern data-driven marketing techniques and train the students as data scientists who can analyze data and make marketing decisions using some of the state-of-the-art tools that are employed in the industry.
We will cover a wide range of topics, including demand modeling, the analysis of household-level data, customer relationship management (CRM) and database marketing, and elements of digital marketing. The focus throughout is on predicting the impact of marketing decisions, including pricing, advertising, and customer targeting, on customer profitability and the return on investment (ROI) from a customer interaction.
The students will get immersed in a workflow that begins with the initial processing of the raw data and ends with the implementation of the marketing decision. First, we will learn how to manage and process large databases. The tools that we will use include SQL and some key packages in R that are designed for big data processing. Second, we will discuss and apply some modern statistical tools building on regression analysis, including Bayesian hierarchical models and some key tools from the machine learning literature. Finally, we will learn how to implement key marketing decisions based on the statistical analysis of the data.
Note: The broad set of topics in this class overlaps with the topics covered in 37103 (Data-Driven Marketing). However, we will cover these topics at a faster pace and emphasize state-of-the-art techniques that are only briefly surveyed or not covered in 37103. Also, the main goal of the data assignments in 37103 is to make the students familiar with some key concepts in data-driven marketing. This class goes above and beyond this goal and introduces the students to a professional data scientist’s workflow used for marketing decision-making."

The primary purpose is to provide marketers with a hands-on experience in developing and interpreting marketing research information to enable more rigor in marketing decision-making and strategy development. The course is structured from the point of view of the marketing executive, product manager, management consultant or entrepreneur who will use research initiatives to understand the beliefs, motivations and reactions of key market constituents and to inform strategy decisions. The new type of strategic marketing required can be referred to as marketing engineering.
Students will work in teams to conduct original marketing research and solve real-world marketing challenges for their client companies. In the past, a wide range of companies have participated in marketing labs including large companies such P&G, Google, Starbucks, Symantec, PepsiCo, Intel, and Walmart as well as successful niche companies such as ErgoBaby, Shutterfly, Chamberlain, Accuweather.com, GardenLites and Cacique. Considerable effort is made in the months prior to the start of this lab class to recruit companies and scope projects that are important to the client company while providing a robust and relevant learning experience for students. The course will cover and client projects will require teams to generate both qualitative and quantitative research. The underlying approach is designed to have students pursue marketing initiatives to help a company address business issues such as growing revenues, increasing gross margins, engaging and keeping customers, etc. These marketing initiatives might include identifying the key factors driving changes in the market, segmenting the market to identify target customers, identifying competitive gaps, positioning the company or products, leveraging brand equity, optimizing a product’s features and configuration, testing new product concepts, gaining insights on pricing, informing advertising and messaging, estimating market potential, and the like. The course will help students to develop a critical eye for marketing research and an understanding of how to leverage the right research approach to address a marketing issue to be solved. The emphasis is on applying research tools and templates rather than on learning the statistical underpinnings and formulas that drive data analyses.
Group projects will be company-sponsored, real-world marketing projects. Student teams will work closely with their clients, with the guidance of an experienced faculty coach, to uncover market, customer and product insights through qualitative research, obtain strategic & relevant proprietary data through structured quantitative research, develop conclusions from data analysis, and provide actionable recommendations to the marketing challenge(s) faced by the company. We have a partnership with a professional market research firm whereby their services and tools are used for implementing an online quantitative survey, including the recruiting of targeted consumers to take the survey. Expect to spend approximately 6-7 hours per week outside of class.

However, making decisions about changes in marketing strategy requires predicting how consumers will behave in a different market context than the one that currently exists. This course covers the use of experimental methods to quantify the causal effect of marketing decisions.
Experimental methods have been used since the early days of marketing in settings such as retail test-markets and direct mail. In recent years, technological change, particularly the proliferation of online A/B testing, has fundamentally altered the methods and benefits of marketing experimentation. This course will cover the fundamentals of conducting marketing experiments and students will learn how to incorporate experimental results into managerial decision making. In particular, we will discuss:
1. The kinds of decisions for which experimental tests are most beneficial compared to alternative approaches.
2. How to design experiments, taking into account factors including cost, sample size and effective treatment rates, analytic complexity, modeling and decision needs, potential information leakage and other sources of bias, and customer reaction.
3. How to statistically analyze experimental results to draw valid conclusions that will generalize reliably to the decisions being made.
4. How to incorporate experimental results into decision making, including differences between tactical and strategic findings, identifying and managing threats to internal and external validity, and incorporating experimentation into long-term knowledge-building.
The course will use a combination of lectures, case studies, hands-on exercises and an exam. Students will learn the tools needed to implement experimental methods in practice, from lab and survey-based experiments and concept tests to in-store, online and direct-communication field testing. We will discuss cases in which experimentation changed the way organizations made decisions, drawing on examples from advertising, online sales, consumer packaged-goods, consumer finance, fundraising and government."

Nowhere is this quote ring true more than in the context of startups. For startups, Marketing is the fundamental component of strategy and the key ingredient in tactical decisions. This course is a 5-week foray into discussing elements of marketing in the context of startups, examining when and why traditional ideas might not work and novel ideas that might.
The course will involve lectures and discussions. Each session (more or less) will feature an external speaker followed by a classroom discussion on a particular topic. The course will strive to balance the practical aspects of marketing with a theoretical understanding of the concepts and frameworks involved.
The class will consist of five sessions/modules that include:
(i) Startup Structure and Strategy, (ii) Customers and Consumers, (iii) Products and Pivots, (iv) Messaging and Measurement and (v) Economics and Exit."

Topics covered include: design thinking, stage-gate and agile innovation processes, innovation strategy, lean startup principles, platform strategy, inventive opportunity identification, perceptual mapping, qualitative and quantitative market research techniques for uncovering customer needs, generating ideas and screening, new product concept statements, concept optimization and testing, new product forecasting methods (including innovation diffusion models), brand extendibility, and new product launch plans.
This course will cover consumer and business-to-business products and services (with an emphasis on consumer products), including examples and cases from high tech, fin tech, food and beverage, household consumer products, telecommunication services, building products, software, medical products, and financial services. Students will learn about and apply current tools for effective new product development including perceptual mapping, design thinking and stage-gate development processes, ethnographic market research techniques, ideation/brainstorming techniques, idea screening models, concept statements and quantitative concept tests, conjoint analysis, forecasting models, new product launch strategies, and new product business cases. This course will also highlight the different roles and functions required for effective new product development. The group project, which consists of three phases with three assignments, enables students to apply these tools on an actual client “lab” project.
Group projects will be company-sponsored, real-world innovation projects. Student teams will work closely with their clients, with the guidance of a faculty coach, to uncover unmet customer needs, generate ideas, develop new product/service concepts test those concepts quantitatively with a representative group of target consumers provided by a professional market research firm, and make recommendations to their clients. Expect to spend approximately 6 – 7 hours per week outside of class.

175,120,438,2017-11-15 13:53:48 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:32 UTC,"The advent of rich marketing data and analytic tools has brought pricing into the forefront of strategic thinking. For most companies, the improvement of pricing strategy is one of the main strategic goals and also one of the main strategic challenges. Most companies struggle with the same basic questions. How do we formulate a pricing strategy? Which data and methods should we be using to make pricing decisions? Who should be in charge of pricing decision-making? In practice, most firms use ad hoc rules of thumb that often fail to generate pricing recommendations that are even close to optimal. The simplicity of these rules of thumb comes at a substantial cost to profitability. Most rules fail to align pricing with the perceived value of consumers and their underlying willingness-to-pay. Many firms also struggle with the delegation of pricing responsibility within the organization, exacerbating the use of simple rules of thumb that fail to deliver effective pricing decisions.
This course blends marketing analytic frameworks, marketing strategy & microeconomic theory, and data to formulate actionable pricing strategies. Students will learn how to coordinate pricing decisions with the rest of the marketing value proposition. Numerous pricing structures are developed in the course, along with their microeconomic foundations. Students will learn the underlying theory for each pricing structure, along with the practical considerations for implementation.
The course combines cases and homework to teach students how to design and execute pricing strategies. Students will be expected to work with different forms of data and corresponding analytic methods. The course will cover pricing strategies across many contexts including services, B2B and international.
During the quarter, there are 4 group homework assignments, 3 group case write-ups and 1 individual case assignment. The individual assignment is due during week 3. If you register late for the course, you must still submit this first assignment in class during week 3. Failure to submit this assignment will result in a grade of zero and no exceptions will be made. Provisional grades can be assigned so long as students complete all the assignments during the quarter.
For some of the group homework assignments, you will need to run a regression and/or use optimization software. Two review sessions have been scheduled with one of the course TAs to assist those students who are unfamiliar with these techniques.
For the group assignments and group case write-ups, students need to form a group of 4-5 people. All group members must be registered for the same section. No exceptions will be made."

This course investigates the tradeoffs firms face in channel management as they bring a product to market. The goal of this course is to develop a general framework for channel management that can be applied to both the initial channel design and its active management. The framework rests on three important economic concepts: information, incentives and coordination.
We will mainly use cases to illustrate how strategies for taking products to market make use of these concepts. Each week, one or two cases are discussed, covering a variety of markets and products. Strategic issues relating to choice of channels, organization, contracting and information flows are emphasized. Many of the cases will address channel conflict, multi-channel coordination, and multi-channel incentives. The cases are complemented with readings that build and expand on key concepts. The case discussions may conclude with a short lecture. You will apply the framework in this course through case discussion, assignments, and a course project. The exam is a take-home case done individually. The course has no pre-requisites."
177,122,509,2017-11-15 13:54:21 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:32 UTC,"Customers are spending more of their time on the digital medium. Therefore companies - both B2C and B2B - are shifting an increasing portion of their marketing budgets to digital marketing to engage them. Also, digital marketing itself is evolving and changing at a fast clip. All of this has created significant challenges for the digital marketer: S/he is left wondering (a) what marketing strategies and techniques to use where & when, and (b) how to keep pace with or stay ahead of the changing digital eco-system.
In DM, students will cultivate a way of thinking that will help them navigate this ever-shifting digital landscape. Also, they will learn how to use various current digital marketing techniques, including: content marketing, advertising, search, apps, games, social media, digital wallets & payments, loyalty programs, location-based, and omni-channel marketing. I have tailored the course such that students will leave equipped with frameworks and strategies that they can apply directly at work today.
By course end, students will have understood: (i) how do digital consumers behave and what are the most effective ways to digitally engage with them, (ii) how one creates digital marketing strategies and programs, (iii) what frameworks and metrics to apply and when, and (iv) how one seamlessly combines digital with traditional off-line marketing programs.
In DM we will cover a broad spectrum of very current topics. To fit this course into a 1-quarter syllabus, I have prioritized topics based on currency, relevance and practical utility. Note that we will not have the bandwidth to deep-dive into specific tactical marketing campaign implementations. Students who already have extensive prior experience with DM should consult with me before signing up for this class."
178,123,507,2017-11-15 13:54:42 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:32 UTC,"Marketing in the digital economy requires strategic and tactical decisions to be made with a high level of precision, at a more granular level and quicker than ever before. It should come as no surprise then that decisions in various marketing functions (including advertising, promotions, pricing and even product design) are now made based on or with the help of data and analytic algorithms. One could say that these algorithms are the marketer’s new competitive toolkit.
In this class we will explore the use of such algorithmic tools in furthering a firm’s digital (and non-digital) marketing goals. In particular, we will focus on methods to capture a consumer’s digital footprint and the algorithms used to use this data to tailor, improve and optimize the firm’s marketing investments. This course will require students to be conversant with digital technologies and somewhat comfortable with data and analytics although expertise is not required.
In addition to classroom discussions the course will feature speakers from firms engaged in algorithmic and digital marketing as well as project(s) that apply tools learnt in class to real problems."

The course is designed to help students improve their skills as leaders, team members, and client managers while developing solutions to real-world business problems. Faculty provide students with tools for solving complex problems and detailed feedback regarding their performance. Students who complete this course report they learn a great deal about their abilities as business professionals and find themselves better prepared to manage complex problems and situations in the workplace.
Guided by faculty coaches who are experienced business professionals, each student group is challenged to solve a client problem as an effective team. In previous years Abbott Labs, Accenture, American Airlines, Ameritrade, Bank of America, BASF, Barclays, Citicorp, Clorox, Dow Chemical, Eli Lilly, Frito-Lay, General Electric, W.W. Grainger, Harman International, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, Kraft, Microsoft, Nabisco, Nestle, Snap-on Tools, and Roche Diagnostics have sponsored real-world projects. Client-sponsors report that the business insights generated by our teams are as good as, and at times even better than, those produced by top tier consulting firms.
We work with our client-sponsors to offer two distinct types of projects each year:
NEW PRODUCT PROJECTS: Clients ask our teams to develop new products and services for consumer or business markets. New product projects can teach students how to generate and evaluate new product concepts, how to develop and test prototypes, how to develop a marketing plan for the new product (including competitive positioning, financial forecasts, distribution plans, packaging, a pricing strategy, and a promotional strategy), and, finally, how to present your results to your client in an effective manner. Note that it is not possible to tackle all of these subjects in a single academic quarter. Project scope will be limited to a subset negotiated by the faculty with the client.
STRATEGY PROJECTS: Clients also ask our teams to improve the business performance of existing products, to identify whole new business ventures, to estimate the commercial potential of new technologies, acquisition targets, or targets for divestment. Our strategy projects teach students through direct experience how to decompose a complex strategic problem, how to develop and implement a research plan to evaluate competing solutions, and how to present your selected solutions to your client.
The tools and techniques you will use in these labs are widely employed by business consultants and managers, although time will focus the team on the tools required to solve your client's problem. If you are interested in obtaining a broad overview of all the tools consultants and marketers could employ in a variety of situations, we recommend that you supplement this course with other Chicago Booth courses. This course, however, provides an ideal opportunity to acquire practical experience in managing a cross disciplinary team engaged in a strategy or marketing consulting project. Project sponsors and a brief description of the projects are announced via an email sent to all Chicago Booth students prior to the beginning of each quarter. Students do not bid for this course. Rather, as further detailed in the email announcement, interested students apply for the course by submitting their resumes for consideration. Questions regarding the course can be directed to the Management Lab Business Manager at 773/702.0635. Please note that because of confidentiality restrictions, the Business Manager cannot provide a description of the content of the projects beyond that set forth in the emailed course announcement.

In addition, marketing professionals, in both B2B and B2C environments, are now expected to have an understanding of how to select, deploy and use a variety of marketing software platforms & services, including advertising (AdTech), content marketing, marketing and sales automation, websites, social media, sales intelligence, and analytics dashboards. The best way to gain such expertise is for these professionals to actually build and execute specific digital marketing programs/strategies using various MarTech platforms in a lab environment
This lab course, DMML, takes students through the process of designing and executing specific digital marketing program components, hands-on. They will work with several marketing platforms and tools including those for creating and managing digital presence, content, mobile-first design, advertising, social media, marketing & sales funnel management, and analytics.
By the end of the course, students will learn how to utilize key MarTech platforms and tools to build out digital marketing programs, and by so doing, they will develop a deep understanding of what it really takes to design and execute digital marketing strategies and campaigns on their own.
There will be a webinar at 12:00 noon on August 9th. Registering for this course is by application only, as this is a lab course with some restrictions on the availability of projects.

The focus of the course is on understanding the methods currently available for analyzing panel data (household purchases, physician prescriptions, etc.). The course begins with an introduction to the various aspects of individual behavior and the econometric models currently available to study them. The remainder of the course will focus on specific advances in such analyses. These include, but are not limited to, the study of purchases across product categories, the analysis of dynamic purchase behavior and accounting for endogeneity in such models. Students will write code in R, Matlab or some similar software; no canned routines are allowed for PhD students."

We will discuss various topics covering current and classic research in consumer behavior with underpinnings in social and cognitive psychology. The class is an advanced research seminar in which students are expected to read, assimilate, and discuss multiple papers on specific topic areas each week. Each student is expected to lead the discussion for an entire topic once or twice in the quarter. Responsibilities will include assigning discussion questions for the week, allocating readings to specific classmates for detailed discussion, and synthesizing the discussion across readings to develop an integrative framework for research in the topic area at the end of that session.

We formulate and estimate models of consumer decision-making, and then explore the normative and positive consequences of the inferred consumer behavior for optimal marketing decisions and market structure. Topics include: Foundations of demand modeling, measurement of consumer heterogeneity, the origin and evolution of preferences, state dependence in demand, dynamic discrete choice models, learning and memory models, storable goods demand, diffusion models and durable goods demand, stated choice models, advertising dynamics, and search and shopping behavior.
This course is geared towards 2nd-year Ph.D. students who have already taken at least one course in Ph.D.-level Price Theory and in Ph.D.-level Empirical Economics."

Developing an accurate understanding of these factors, however, can be difficult to achieve because intuitions are often misguided and unstructured experience can be a poor teacher. This course is intended to address this development by providing the scientific knowledge of human thought and behavior that is critical for successfully managing others, and also for successfully managing ourselves.
Using a combination of lectures, discussions, and group activities, the course offers an introduction to theory and research in the behavioral sciences. Its primary goal is to develop conceptual frameworks that help students to understand and manage effectively their own complicated work settings.
The course is organized into two main sections: (1) the individual, and (2) the organization. The first half of the course is concerned with issues related to individual behavior, such as how people’s attitudes influence their actions, how people form impressions of others and attribute causes of behavior, and how the choices people make are influenced by characteristics of the decision-maker and the decision-making process. The second half of the course turns to people’s behavior in the context of a larger enterprise. It addresses how organizations can successfully coordinate the actions of their members. Topics in this section include effective group decision-making, persuading and motivating others, and the use of formal and informal power in interpersonal relations."

Executives make decisions today that lead to unforeseen problems tomorrow, competitors mispredict their rival’s moves and motives, and coworkers misperceive each other’s thoughts and feelings. This course highlights how the human mind comes to make such errors, and what to do about them—ultimately, to understand how to manage yourself and others just a bit more wisely, both in the work environment and in daily life.
To accomplish this goal we will draw upon experimental social psychology, the bedrock of the course. Through laboratory findings and basic science, each week you will learn well-tested, well-replicated insights about social life: you will be armed with management wisdom that works as opposed to management wisdom that “sounds right.” The first half of the course—Internal Thought—outlines the psychological underpinnings of how people form preferences, plan for the future, and take others’ perspectives. The latter half—External Change—applies these insights to understanding real organizational issues like power dynamics, culture, working in groups, and attaining work-life balance."

With respect to the second type of situation, you will learn about the errors """"normal people"""" often commit when they make decisions intuitively. You will also learn how to overcome these errors and thereby become smarter than most “normal people”. This course has two goals: descriptive and prescriptive. The descriptive goal is to understand how people actually make decisions. The prescriptive goal is to help students become better decision makers. Through readings, demonstrations, and cases, students understand why managers are susceptible to certain decision making biases and therefore, often make less than optimal decisions.

Whether you’re selling a product, pitching a startup, soliciting donations, trying to shape public policy, or revolutionizing an industry, the ability to persuade others is critical. “Command and control” is usually an illusion. If you want to effect change, you need to overcome skepticism and opposition in order to win minds and alter actions. Everyone’s influence—from the CEO to an intern—is determined by how good they are at getting ideas across and persuading others. Conversely, the most logical, sensible, and rational ideas can fail because they’re expressed poorly and unconvincingly.
This course is a highly practical guide to expressing your ideas more persuasively. We’ll take simple techniques for improving and sharpening our arguments, and practice delivering them in a compelling way. In week one, we’ll look at why we need to persuade, the strategy of deciding whom to persuade, and analyze some of the barriers to persuasion. Weeks two and three will focus on how to structure your communication. In week four, we’ll turn to the characteristics of great communication, the process involved in crafting your arguments, and how to build a persuasive presence. In the final session, we’ll talk about how to apply what we’ve learned to the challenges we face as we build our careers.
You will have writing and reading assignments every week, and video assignments most weeks. Some will be based on your personal experience, some on case studies written specifically for the course. The final assignment will be an in-depth video exercise. You will also develop a personal persuasion plan which we will use to help you track your progress after the course. The course will be made up of lectures, videos, discussion, case studies, and exercises.
You will be judged on how well you have absorbed and applied the course material, rather than on the beauty of your rhetorical flourishes.

This is a companion course to “Persuasion: Effective Business Communication” (course number 38101), and completing 38101 is a strict pre-requisite. We’ll enrich the basic narrative structure we learned in 38101 by looking at how behavioral biases play into persuasion, by examining how to make technical and complex ideas straightforward without dumbing them down, and by practicing presenting and persuading in many different contexts.
Like 38101, this is a highly practical course that aims to make effective narrative persuasion a habit that you will be able to use in a broad variety of situations. There will be more complex video and live presentation exercises, real-life cases of persuasion in a corporate context, and a chance to work in detail on a personal persuasion scenario from your professional life.
We’ll spend more time critiquing each other’s work, which should improve your ability to persuade, to analyze others’ communication, as well as to handle and learn from criticism. You should emerge a better writer and presenter, comfortable communicating your narrative whatever the medium."

(1) to develop an analytical framework that will help you better understand negotiation situations and the challenges they entail.
(2) to provide you with extensive experience in the negotiation process, with the goal that you develop your repertoire of negotiation tactics and strategies and that you further your ability to correctly evaluate the costs and benefits of these alternative strategies."

You will learn from an extensive set of negotiation experiences in class, practice your skills, and benefit from feedback. In the early class sessions, we introduce basic negotiation concepts and tactics. In the classes that follow, we focus on specific aspects of the negotiation process that are important to many negotiation situations, such as obstacles to effective communication at the bargaining table, the maximization of multiple interests, and tactics for coalition building. In the final set of classes, we put it all together by exploring negotiations that contain elements of both cooperation and competition; that is, these sessions involve cases where the parties can “enlarge the pie” by creating joint gains. Because little in business (or life) gets done without negotiation, this course has the potential to deliver significant upside in your professional and personal outcomes."

This course will guide you through the science and art of negotiation. You will learn theories of negotiation during lectures and through assigned readings, and you will learn the practice of negotiation through exercises and case analyses. Throughout the course, you will develop an understanding of how negotiation situations might be structured and what kinds of biases can interfere with successful negotiation (as well as strategies for avoiding these biases)."

First, you will learn what psychological research has discovered about how people negotiate—strategies that work and common mistakes people make. Second, you will practice these strategies in negotiation exercises. These experiences will help you gain insight into how you negotiate and what you need to improve. Third, Professor Talhelm will use his expertise as a cultural psychologist and experience running businesses in China to teach about cultural differences in negotiation. This section is a good choice for anyone interested empirical approaches to negotiation and people interested in working in other cultures."

The ability to negotiate effectively is a critical skill. This course will help you understand and develop negotiation skills using various methods. You will learn the theories of negotiation during lectures and through assigned readings, and you will learn the practice of negotiation through exercises and case analyses. You will interact in a variety of negotiation situations, learn portable negotiation strategies as part of a broader analytical framework, and understand what kinds of biases can interfere with successful negotiation (as well as strategies for avoiding these biases)."

207,138,572,2017-11-15 14:03:40 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:34 UTC,"This course builds on 38103, Strategies and Processes of Negotiation, and is designed to increase your understanding of the theory and process of negotiation. The course will include advanced topics that expand upon or were not covered in 38103. In particular, the course will improve your ability to deal with difficult negotiators and difficult negotiations. 38103 introduced the basic ideas of negotiations—BATNAs, effective tactics for distributive negotiations, processes and analytics behind the discovery of joint gains, and coalitional dynamics in multi-party settings. This course will discuss advanced concepts of negotiations by taking you through a set of negotiation exercises that are more complex and more authentic than the ones used in 38103. The exercises will include: integrative negotiations without scoring systems, dynamic negotiations, complex deal structuring negotiations, sustaining negotiated value, and negotiations that require coordination of internal and external parties.
The more advanced deal making and deal design skills developed in this course should be especially useful to students whose careers will involve investment banking; business development; venture capital, private equity investment, and entrepreneurial firms; and alliances and joint ventures, as well as students who anticipate conducting a substantial amount of intra-organizational negotiations.
The course will use a combination of role-playing simulations and case discussions that include topics such as strategic alliances; dysfunctional business relationships; and negotiating with Wal-mart.
Note: All students must attend the first week of class."
208,139,533,2017-11-15 14:03:57 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:34 UTC,"The primary aim of this class is to help students define for themselves a canon of business ethics that is tailored to their professional goals. We will build a vocabulary for talking about business ethics by examining the work of a wide variety of authors – from economists and entrepreneurs to philosophers, journalists, and revolutionaries – all of whom have written about the place of business (and the business professional) in the modern world. These authors include Benjamin Franklin, Andrew Carnegie, Karl Marx, George Orwell, Ayn Rand, and, most importantly, Adam Smith, whose work we will revisit throughout the course. Topics include:
• The Constitution of “Self-Interest”
• The Role of Empathy in Commercial Relationships
• The Moral Status of “Usefulness”
• Philanthropy and the Responsibilities of Wealth
• The Free-Market as an Engine for Virtue and Vice
• The Ideals of Capitalism vs. Lived Experience
The questions we will take up are large, contentious, and open-ended. Through in-class and online discussion, the course will help students determine their own answers, defend them intelligently, and recognize the merits of answers that other students give.
Please note that this class takes a “great books” approach to the topic of business ethics. As such, while contemporary events will be used as illustrations in class discussion, the readings for the course are drawn from seminal works of history, literature, and political economy from the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries rather than from traditional case studies. Please also note that there are weekly writing assignments rather than problem sets."
209,140,579,2017-11-15 14:04:08 UTC,2017-11-26 05:32:56 UTC,"This is a course about teams: How to lead a team, encourage creativity, ensure coordination, deal with difficult team members, improve teams' decision making and performance, get the most out of a team, and manage the boundaries between the team and other parts of the organization from which the team draws resources and authority. Students are assigned to a team at the beginning of the quarter. Teams analyze cases of outstanding and poor teamwork, then complete a group project and analyze their own teamwork and outcomes."
210,141,440,2017-11-15 14:13:12 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:34 UTC,"This class rests on the assumption that you want to lead a good life. """"Good"""" in two senses of the word. First, """"good"""" in the sense of ethical and honorable, a life led with integrity, dignity, and adherence to high ethical standards in your professional life. Second, """"good"""" in the sense of well-being, a life rich in happiness, meaning, or purpose. If you wanted to increase your odds of living a good life, what would you do? If you wanted to lead an organization that not only did well, but did “good,” how would you lead them? If you wanted to manage a team that also lived a good life, how should you manage them?
This is primarily a course about ethics, but it is far from a typical ethics course. We will not spend time discussing ethical dilemmas, or trying to decide what is right or wrong in ethical settings. Instead, we will adopt a psychological approach to understanding ethical behavior. We will try to provide some answers to the most fundamental problem in all of ethics: why do good people sometimes do bad things? Answering this question requires a fundamental understanding of the psychological processes that govern human thought and behavior in ethical domains. It requires understanding the processes underlying moral psychology. These psychological processes can lure anyone—including you and I—into the ethical lapses that ruin careers, destroy businesses, and bring shame to individuals and organizations. Understanding these processes will give you insights into how you would design your life, your organization, and your team so that it not only does well in life, but also lives a good life. We will end this course by discussing what scientists have learned about the other aspect of a good life: wellbeing, happiness, meaning, and purpose. Ethics and hedonics are sometimes described as opposites: either you do good or you feel good, but you don’t do both. The existing empirical evidence on wellbeing demonstrates that this is simply untrue.
Finally, let me note that this course is an experiment. Existing research on the consequences of teaching business ethics suggests that it may be ineffective. Those who take business ethics classes appear to behave no more ethically than those who do not take such classes. I think this is because the standard business ethics class takes the wrong approach. It tries to teach ethical principles rather than ethical practice. It takes a philosophical or theological approach rather than a data-driven psychological approach. It tries to influence your ethical beliefs rather than trying to help you live by ethical principles that are widely known, believed, and accepted. This course is an attempt to teach ethics, and hedonics, differently. It is part of a growing movement in the world’s major business schools to teach ethics as a psychological problem rather than as a philosophical or theological problem. It is a course designed to give you tools to enable good people, like you and I, to live a good life.

This is a class about learning-by-doing, and most of that doing will happen outside of the classroom. You will be handed a big, ambiguous, messy real-world challenge and asked to identify and tackle a small, manageable chunk of it during the three quarters. This means developing, evolving, and sticking to a project plan, understanding the relevant organizational and user context, diagnosing what is going on from behavioral science perspective, and developing psychologically-informed solutions. One or more of those solutions you’ll further refine into concrete hypotheses to put to the test in a randomized controlled experiment, to ultimately deliver your partner organization with new knowledge, communications, tools or other products to improve their choice architecture. You will be researching, observing, writing, listening, debating, creating, testing, analyzing, and presenting – all to implement a real and valuable change in your partner organization’s world. This is not about creating a report to sit and gather dust on a shelf.
Your work in this course will primarily be done as a member of one of several small teams. Each team will be paired up with a partner organization that seeks to understand how it can integrate the tools of behavioral science to further a major initiative, and your work to advance that goal will progress from Fall 2016 through Spring 2017. In-class lectures (from faculty as well as guest organization leaders), discussion, and coaching sessions will be scheduled throughout the year to support each team’s schedule of offline project work.
Overall, this course aims to enhance your understanding and experience with both the benefits and challenges of incorporating behavioral science into the workplace. In so doing, you will gain the insight and skill necessary to be a smarter, more impactful choice architect in your own jobs and lives outside of the classroom."

The course will be divided into two parts. The first half of the course (led by Jane) will cover current topics related to the psychology of intuitive belief and judgment, including magical thinking and superstition, rituals, stereotyping and automatic inferences, and interventions for improving attitudes and experiences for those in conflict or who have been disadvantaged. The second half (led by Ann) will address four distinct topics in consumer research, an area of study to which many managerial and organizational behavior students ultimately contribute. These topics are anthropomorphism, decision making about food, numerosity, and social influences. The first week on anthropomorphism will involve a short presentation by the professor who has worked in the area.
The purpose of this seminar is to stimulate future research, by you, on the course topics. During the first half of the quarter, in each class we will discuss both work conducted by Jane and related work by others. In the second half, we will review recent research on topics of importance in consumer research, which has been examined from different angles and, in some cases, different paradigms. We will examine this work critically to assess present contribution, open questions, and possible avenues of integration."

220,150,525,2017-11-15 14:15:57 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:34 UTC,"Executives and managers face a common problem: how to craft a strategy and design an organization to execute that strategy. This is not about the day-to-day operations of the firm, but about designing the firm for execution, in order to achieve competitive advantage.
The first challenge for the executive is to understand the competitive forces in an industry or market. But this is not enough. Some firms in “bad” markets routinely outperform; others in good markets cannot keep up with the competition.
And markets are not static. Changing tastes, new technologies, and fierce competition rapidly change external conditions. Executives must continually evaluate firm design to keep up with changing times – and identify how to change the environment to its advantage. Structure is crucial to this task. Poor design destroys value, while a well-organized firm can create value in seemingly hopeless situations.
This course provides tools to assess whether an organization’s strategy is suited to its current environment, and whether is structured to execute its strategy. We also cover how the executive can design the firm to change the environment and create new types of competitive advantage. Lessons are uncovered through case-based analysis."
221,150,543,2017-11-15 14:16:11 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:35 UTC,"Success in management requires both the ability to formulate a winning strategy and the skills to guide employees in executing it. A manager’s brilliant ideas about strategy are ultimately worth little if she or he is unable to translate them into actions that both deliver value to customers and enable the firm to capture a portion of the value created. Yet, managers often overemphasize strategy development while giving short shrift to execution.
In this course, we will examine the complex role of social organization – the firm’s formal structure, its culture, and the characteristics of the people who work there – in strategy execution. This course provides students with an overarching framework for thinking about the relationship between strategy, the organization and the firm’s environment. Using this framework, students will identify and characterize the strategies and organizational structures of existing firms, assess alignment between strategy and organizational structure, and identify steps a firm could take to increase the likelihood of executing its strategy successfully. We will consider topics such as innovation, mergers/acquisitions, new ventures, and organizational change.
The class is primarily case-based and it is heavily focused on class discussion."

A framework for analyzing the relationships between strategy, industry structure, firm structure, and competitive advantage is used throughout the course. The real learning, however, comes from in-depth analysis and discussion of firms’ evolution (or lack thereof) in response to internal and external pressures. Several lenses for viewing the relationship between strategy and structure will be introduced during the course."

There is particular emphasis on building models for making strategic decisions in the context of significant technology, demand, and competitive uncertainty.
Application of the tools developed in the course requires a clear understanding of the particular technology(s) underlying the industries that we study. Hence, the course will require a significant amount of reading, above and behind the conceptual readings and cases.

A working knowledge of operations is also indispensable to those interested in marketing, finance, and accounting, where the interface between these functions and operations is critical. Finally, an understanding of how firms become market leaders through operations is important in investment careers.
Most weeks consist of in-depth case discussion, integrated with theory. As such, the course is ideal preparation for many cases encountered during first-year internship interviews, as well as second-year interviews."

We consider a wide range of industries: from traditional services such as restaurants, hospitals, e-commerce, professional services, and services from both the public and private sector. We consider a service one in which the customer is involved, actively or passively, in the production process, and we strive to understand and leverage the role customers play in the process. This course draws ideas not only from operations management, but also from consumer behavior, marketing, and strategy. The course is a mix of softer more qualitative frameworks and more analytical pursuits.
Our Service Model has four parts: The Service Offering (what customer needs and expectations does the service emphasize, and which ones will it sacrifice?), Firm Value (does the service provide value for the stakeholders?), Employee Value (does the service provide value to the employees?) and Customer Value (does the service provide value to customers so that they are willing to play their role?).
Process Flows are used to understand the aggregated flow of customers through a process to address issues such as capacity utilization, throughput, and waiting time of a system. We will cover the basics of process flow analysis that is also covered in Bus 40000, but with a focus on service processes. As such there will be some overlap with the content of Bus 40000 (roughly 1/4 of this course), and so a student may consider choosing to take only one of either this course or Bus 40000.
We use Customer Interaction Diagrams depict the flow of a single customer. They are useful in examining the interactions between the firm and its customers, and can help explore service innovations, and the role management should play.

Every day, more data on provider performance is becoming available to consumers to help them make better informed decisions about their healthcare. Hospital revenues are being driven more and more by clinical results through incentive programs for improving hospital readmissions, patient safety, costs, and patient outcomes. At the same time, population health is improving as Big Data is being used to learn what treatments are most effective at an unprecedented pace and scale. These forces are transforming the healthcare industry and public health.
In this class, you will learn the baseline knowledge, tools, and skills necessary to work effectively with large, real-world healthcare datasets. In particular, you will learn the underlying logic and calculations of hospital reimbursement and outcomes measurement, through classroom instruction and hands-on learning, working directly with patient-level claims datasets from CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) and elsewhere.
Students will have exclusive access to state-of-the-art commercial software tools that permit data preparation and collaboration on datasets too large to work with efficiently using spreadsheets. Data manipulation and analyses will be done using a combination of both point-and-click recipes and pre-prepared analysis scripts in the statistical software package R. By the end of the course, students will be better prepared to conduct a real-world data analysis project at a healthcare institution or a consultancy."

The Healthcare Analytics Laboratory will focus on applying data-driven analytics and insights to identify and create healthcare delivery efficiencies. Student teams will work on real-world improvement projects with prominent healthcare institutions.
The Laboratory provides students with opportunities to:
1. Apply and reinforce tools and frameworks developed elsewhere in the Booth curriculum;
2. Develop leadership skills and build effectiveness in teams;
3. Learn a healthcare context deeply through an intensive project experience;
4. Develop proficiency at presenting data analyses to executive audiences;
5. Impact real-world healthcare delivery.
Thus, the course will help students develop the skills required to successfully deliver evidence-based management analytics in the real world. Projects will be carefully scoped, and most data will be acquired, before the course begins so that students can make steady progress towards clear, attainable goals. Students will present milestones every two weeks to the instructional team (which consists of the faculty instructor and graduate students who serve as project mentors) and, on occasion, to the entire class. Final presentations will be delivered at hospital sponsor sites to physicians and executives. The course is for students interested in leveraging the academic rigor of data and decision analysis to improve healthcare delivery. It is an excellent course for those interested in careers in or related to the healthcare industry, and business analytics more broadly.

Course description
You decide to establish a start-up in marketing consulting. You search the Internet and find to your dismay well over 650 companies in that area, each one claiming to be best and unique. In order to compete in this arena you need to have the ability to identify upcoming trends and new problems in the marketing area, AND to be able to provide original, sound, fast and applicable solutions to these problems. One such example that is not dealt by many of the marketing consulting companies is the following shelf-planning problem.
Imagine a customer in a deli store on a Sunday morning intending to buy bagels. There are only two bagels on the shelf. What would you predict the person would do? Hurry up and buy the only remaining bagels before they are gone? Would he consider the two bagels as being the least fresh, touched and left by all former customers, and therefore decide to wait for a fresher batch? As a consultant to the store manager, how would you determine the optimal number of bagels that should be on the shelf at a given time in order to avoid making customers reluctant to buy?
As it turns out, the methodology covered by this course, that solves the above-mentioned problem, can also be used for the analysis of customer attrition, sale promotion and more.
Unlike marketing research, marketing consulting is a problem-solving endeavor that requires a great deal of specificity and is fueled by experience. This course is meant to give future consultants and entrepreneurs important tools and ways of thinking that are relevant for dealing with insightful consulting and are useful in the practice of marketing consulting and beyond.
The course addresses a variety of practical consulting problems and their solutions. Some examples are: (1) Optimal shelf-planning (see the bagels example above); (2) Analyzing customer attrition as a process (rather than as an event-driven phenomenon); (3) Prediction of a customer's purchase behavior (buying intentions, buying propensity, etc.) from the customer's patterns of usage of media, life style, political orientation, etc.; (4) Analysis of satisfaction -how to create a VALID satisfaction scale, how to rank products by satisfaction of customers, how to detect easy-to-please customers, etc.; (5) Analysis of brand loyalty -how to measure loyalty, how to determine whether loyalty to certain brands exists, and how to quantify it; (6) Optimizing predictive modeling when financial rewards and penalties exist in regard to correct and incorrect prediction, respectively.
The course is taught in a way that emphasizes the interpretation of results rather than computations. Although this course uses statistical reasoning, it is NOT too mathematical in nature. To aid in the analysis, an R-based software containing original and user-friendly statistical programs will be used in this course.
Teaming up: Students are required to form working teams of up to 3 students per team. Homework assignments are handed-in as one hard copy per team that includes names of all team members."

It focuses on strategic decisions that drive profitability. Class time will be devoted to case discussions and lectures.
The first half of the course takes a price theory approach to managerial decision-making. The actions of rivals are mostly assumed fixed, so we can isolate key tradeoffs that they face. The second half takes a game theory approach, in which managers’ actions directly affect their rivals’ payoffs, and vice versa. It considers strategic decisions of first-order importance. Topics include pricing, positioning, patterns and determinants of cross-industry and within-industry profitability, entry and exit, vertical integration and boundaries of the firm (i.e. the “make or buy” decision), commitment, cooperation, deterrence, network effects, and multisided platforms (MSPs)."

273,179,431,2017-11-15 14:29:11 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:37 UTC,"A student who recently took this course suggested the sub-title of ""Strategies for Individuals and Their Organizations"" or ""The Artistry of Strategy."" While the sub-titles do capture the content of this course, I have decided to honor the historical name, ""Business Policy,"" because it connotes a general management perspective, the importance of people in moving an organization toward its goals, openness to many modes of thinking, and the critical link between strategy and implementation.
By the end of the course students should: 1) feel comfortable in working in a strategy versus maintenance space; 2) be more fluent in using the vocabulary and tools of leading strategy and management consultants; 3) know when the specialized knowledge and techniques that form much of the M.B.A. curriculum are useful, and when they are not; and 4) be excited about their own career and personal strategy.
WARNING LABEL: Although the course familiarizes the student with current and past practice in strategic planning, I also structure the learning environment as a forum for challenging current approaches and dogma, and as a place to experiment with some new ways to think about business practice. On the basis of past experience, students who enjoy 'unconventional' ways of thinking and learning about strategy (which I believe is an inherently open-ended topic) will probably enjoy this class more than those who prefer not to deviate much from a more traditional approach to this subject."
274,180,431,2017-11-15 14:29:26 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:37 UTC,"Over the past several years we have taught numerous courses in strategy, leadership and business policy in all of the Chicago Booth's M.B.A. programs including the Executive Program and the International Executive Program in Barcelona. As a result of our collaboration in developing these courses, we have gathered a large variety of material on approaches, ideas and questions about strategy. Over the years we have also discussed these issues with business executives as well as practitioners from fields outside of business.
Based on this background and material, we introduced a new course a few years ago. We felt the course was a success and we are offering it again this year. The course brings together a group of about 30 students to meet with us and visitors (business executives and others) to explore some of these issues and ideas in greater depth. The goals of the course will be to develop a better understanding of methods and techniques of strategic thinking and to explore the design, implementation and evaluation of strategy. One important goal is to develop tools and concepts for evaluating strategies both before and after the outcome is known and to seek insights that will improve the process of designing strategy.
The course will be developed around reading and presentations (from visitors as well as members of the class) and, as a symposium, class discussion and interaction will be very important. In addition, the course will require a project carried out with two or three others."
275,181,422,2017-11-15 14:29:47 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:37 UTC,"The course will introduce students to the functions and duties of directors and boards, and to the topics boards in the United States most commonly face. The content will be applicable to both public and private corporations and not for profit organizations. The differences in corporate governance in other countries, as well as current trends in corporate governance, will be discussed.
The topics covered include the role of Directors and the Board in:
Board Development Board Member Selection & Evaluation Board Responsibilities & Legal and Compliance Duties Sarbanes Oxley Fiduciary Integrity CEO Selection, Evaluation, and Succession Planning Compensation Practices Corporate Strategy Shareholder Communications Crisis, Bankruptcy, and Dissidents Private Firms and Not For Profit Organizations International Governance Global Trends
Format The course utilizes the case method and practical examples of real situations are discussed each week. For students to benefit from the course, they must prepare thoroughly for, and actively participate in each class. Students will be part of a 5 person group in the course. Each group will prepare a 2 page weekly paper on the case being discussed starting in week 2. Each group will also research and prepare one paper on international governance in a specific country. Each group will present their paper to the class. There will be no exams."
276,182,450,2017-11-15 14:29:58 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:37 UTC,"Most strategic decisions involve investment – investment in physical capital, investment in human capital, or investment in knowledge capital. In strategy classes we study the qualitative aspects of strategic investment decisions; in finance classes we learn quantitative methods to value investment projects. In this class, we will develop and apply a variety of tools to achieve greater understanding and sophistication in strategic investment decision-making.
Discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is the basic model for valuing investment projects that is the core of corporate practice and capital budgeting sections of corporate finance classes. This course focuses on ways to use richer modeling tools to improve strategic decision-making. The most important difference in the tools we develop is that they explicitly focus on the uncertainty inherent in strategic investments. Richer models of uncertainty make the underlying assumptions about the evolution of the industry and the firm’s position more transparent, making them a better tool for communication and debate among decision-makers. Explicit models of uncertainty allow one to incorporate the value of flexibility, i.e., real options, into strategic decision-making processes.
Building richer models of uncertainty for valuation and strategic decision-making processes is the focus of the course. We will study different methods for doing this, including scenario analysis, decision trees, binomial lattices, and numerical simulations. We will also consider situations where the environmental uncertainty includes actions of rivals by studying how game theoretic concepts can be incorporated into the models. The key skill that we will work hard to develop through strategy cases and modeling exercises is the ability to take a complex, ambiguous strategic problem and build a tractable model that captures the quantitative implications of the key strategic tradeoffs and most important uncertainties.

FORMAT
This course being taught with what is sometimes called a “flipped classroom”; we are doing in class what is typically done at home – working individually and in groups on problems and cases; and doing at home what we typically do in class – listening to lectures – in this case via a collection of videos. The main benefit to this approach is that it will allow you to work on learning the tools and their application with more frequent and richer feedback from me and from your peers than is possible with the traditional approach. In addition, we will be able to discuss the cases in class in order to reach consensus on the strategic issues before working in groups during class to build models that capture the key strategic tradeoffs. The class will meet in Room 140 at Booth 455 a room designed specifically for working in groups as well as sharing work within groups and among groups. This is an experiment but I am confident that this is the best way for you to learn the tools and master their application."
277,183,481,2017-11-15 14:30:10 UTC,2017-11-26 05:41:28 UTC,"In terminology of economics a game is any situation where the best course of actions depends on what others will do. Under this definition, most business environments are games. Game theory is a framework for analyzing games. The course will focus on two questions: (i) how to design games (i.e., how to structure the business environment), and (ii) how to play games (i.e., how to predict what others will do and respond appropriately)."
278,184,454,2017-11-15 14:30:19 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:37 UTC,"This class will analyze strategy and economics of platform industries—businesses that connect buyers, sellers and third-party providers. A great deal of the digital economy takes place this way from app stores, online advertising, social media and social networks, online software companies, media, news and entertainment companies and many others.
This course will be a predominantly case based examination of many different varieties of such businesses and the ways they compete. It will present frameworks to identify platform industries and understand the dynamics of those industries over time such as whether they will be concentrated or have many successful companies. It will explore the use and viability of various platform business models: user subscription fees, advertising, 'freemium' pricing, charging developers and so on. It will also explore the different strategies for newly entering platforms challenging and incumbent and for established players trying to prevent competitors from rising.
The course will be graded on class participation, case write-ups and a final exam. Note: In autumn 2017, class will meet in weeks 2-6 instead of weeks 1-5. In spring, class will meet in weeks 6-10."

Students will develop an analytical and theoretical framework to understand the M&A process and will also use cases and real-world applications to develop skills necessary to prepare and evaluate the strategic rationale for a proposed transaction. This course uses a strategic corporate development perspective rather than an investment banking/transaction perspective. Topics include strategic rationale for M&A transactions, value creation and destruction in M&A, the M&A process, interplay between strategy and valuation, and implementation/integration issues. The student will apply course learnings in a cumulative project typically by preparing a preliminary business case for a proposed transaction.
Students should note that this is a strategy course, not a finance course."
281,187,534,2017-11-15 14:31:08 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:38 UTC,"This course aims to provide students, as future decision makers, with a set of tools to engage and deal with the media, and to develop communications and non-market strategies in a complicated world with multiple stakeholders. Students will become sophisticated consumers of media, specifically, of financial and business news media, and will develop an awareness of the far reaching influence of the news media on what they “know,” what they think is important, and the perspective they take on issues, as well as the drivers that influence the for-profit news media.
This course explores the relationship between business, regulators, and the media. All businesses face multiple stakeholders: shareholders, customers, employees, activists, NGOs, politicians, and regulators. Their interaction with stakeholders is conducted mainly through the media. Media has a major role in shaping corporate reputation vis-a-vis their stakeholders, regulators, and potential business partners.
We begin the course by exploring the relationship between business and regulation and the non-market strategies which businesses employ to influence their regulatory environment. Next, we dive deeper into the business model of the media to see how it affects relationships with corporations, and inspect the media’s resulting influence on politicians, regulators, businesses, voters, and consumers. We conclude the course by exploring particular non-market forces and strategies, such as the role of corporate reputation and crisis management techniques.
This course usually features three to four 1.5-hour guest lectures by leading experts in the industry. In the past, students enrolled in this class had the opportunity to learn and engage with more than a dozen guest lecturers, who hold, or held, prominent roles in large corporations in regulation, compliance, government relations, and public relations.
Provisional grading will be available for non-Booth and joint degree graduating students."

How do companies that are yet to turn a profit command a value of billions of dollars; what differentiates the entrepreneurs who succeed in raising money; what is the basis for effective lobbying and rule-shaping; how do managers create trust and change attitudes and behaviors of their team? Many of these stories begin with the importance of good stories and powerful narratives.
To help students develop a clearer point of view about the impact of stories in business, we will start by discussing how much of our reality is “real,” and continue by examining the role of stories in our lives, while also identifying the characteristics of good stories and successful storytellers. We will then add the concept of power and how the combination of power and narrative influences political, economic, and business ideas and structures. Next, we will investigate how companies use stories to gain and maintain dominance and look specifically at case studies of companies that mastered storytelling and strategic narratives. We will finish our journey with a debate on the viability of narratives in the current era and discuss how “alternative facts,” “fake news,” and other “post-truth” world phenomena change the way we use stories in business. What is the future of storytelling when so many people call authoritative information sources into question? Is a new method of storytelling required? These are the major questions that will drive the course.
This course explains and demonstrates the importance of narratives and storytelling tools in most of the efforts and processes that seek to acquire power and influence—not only within organizations, but very often outside of them—when interacting with customers, competitors, regulators, politicians, and the media."

Entrepreneurs and managers can no more ignore the laws of the state than they can the laws of physics. This course will provide a general introduction to law and business. It will do so using traditional legal analysis, supplemented by a substantial use of law and economics. Topics to be covered include: choice of corporate form; capital markets laws, including venture capital and IPOs; antitrust; intellectual property; telecommunications and the regulation of natural monopoly; and e-Commerce."

Joe Raudabaugh (MBA’80), a senior partner with A.T. Kearney and founder of the firm’s Student Lab program, is the sponsor. Joe’s interest in experiential education started at Chicago when he was a student in one of Professor Davis’ original New Product Laboratory classes.
Students have two objectives in this course: to (1) address the complex, strategic business problems brought by clients and develop actionable, data-driven recommendations and (2) to develop their own action and insight skills, both as individuals and as members of a team. In addition to project deliverables, reflection assignments throughout the quarter form the basis of the final grade. (For more on action and insight skills, see “Rethinking Management Education: A View from Chicago” by Harry L. Davis and Robin M. Hogarth.)
Six team projects will be created from up to 40 students. Each project will center on an important strategic challenge and require students to apply a broad set of concepts and tools. A.T. Kearney will coordinate client participation, supplement faculty with consulting resources to coach and support the student teams, and provide collaboration technologies to enable the teams and clients to work virtually. Previous clients have included 3M, Campbell Soup, Georgia Pacific, Nike, Walgreens, Feeding America, Emerson, IDEX, Avendra, Innerworkings, Valkre, Accretive Health, and Walmart. Project descriptions will be posted here the week of February 8.

285,191,445,2017-11-15 14:32:04 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:38 UTC,"This course is built around a continuous time simulation that requires players to integrate concepts and tools learned in the Booth MBA program.
Student teams participate in a market environment in which they make and implement financing, investing, product design, production, distribution, and other marketing and operating decisions.
• Supply chain relationships require negotiations with other teams.
• Task allocation within teams requires effective teamwork, decision-making, management and leadership skills.
• Historical data provides a basis for modeling and statistical analysis.
• The final project is based on a summary of the strategic, investing, financing and operating choices made during the simulation period and requires you to perform a valuation of your company.
Similar to a live business environment, the play and outcome of the simulation depends on the actions taken by the market participants. Teams must be able to pivot and adapt their strategies and partnerships in order to succeed.
See syllabus for information about teams, class meeting specifics, website, game play etc.
This course is new in the MBA program, so no course evaluations are available. However, a similar course is taught in the EMBA program and evaluations are available online (CNet credentials required)."
286,192,534,2017-11-15 14:32:18 UTC,2017-11-27 16:37:38 UTC,"The interaction between business, regulators, and media is of great importance for future decision makers. In business, we see reputation, branding and public discourage having a growing influence on most corporations vis-à-vis all their stakeholders. In regulation, we notice the significance of media in setting the agenda and influencing the regulator’s reputation, and incentives and ideas. When faced as executives with a news story, a media crisis, a media driven economic or business event, it is crucial to be able to map and understand the players, the incentives, and the dynamics, as well to analyze the non-market forces that influence corporations.
This lab course exposes students to live regulatory and media challenges faced by companies and provide them with a set of tools to deal with the media. This course is taught in collaboration with Tusk Ventures, a venture capital company that works with growing startups to help them navigate through governmental, political, and media hurdles. Each group of students will be paired with one of Tusk Ventures’ portfolio startups to create and present a regulatory or media strategic plan, while consistently engaging with the high level of ambiguity surrounding early stage companies. Tusk Ventures will supplement the material taught in class with consulting resources to coach and support the groups. This experience will give the students an opportunity to put into practice some of the skills and strategies that they will learn during the course.
The course will feature three to four 1.5-hour guest lectures by leading experts in the industry. The order of the topics in the class may change according to guest lecture.

Students also will be admitted to a workshop session either on Monday 1:30-2:50 (42706-01) or 3:10-4:30 (42706-02) at Harper or 7:40-9 at Gleacher (42706-81).
Course description and motivation (42706/42707):
This is a lab course focused on entrepreneurship in the urban context. Urban challenges require new approaches and players. Entrepreneurs have an expanding and unprecedented opportunity to participate by addressing challenges in city living and governance with new profitable business models. For example, recent start-ups are devoted to making cities safer while earning a profit, making downtown housing affordable by offering a new “iPhone of apartments” and by a matching platform for finding roommates, saving municipalities money by bringing the sharing economy to city government, producing dramatic increases in recycling behavior in urban households, turning inner-city drop-outs to graduates, and providing tailored urban commuting solutions by crowdsourcing routes.
The course was co-developed with entrepreneur and venture capitalist, Stonly Baptiste. Stonly is a Co-Founder and Partner of Urban Us, a venture fund investing in seed and early stage startups that make cities and city life better. He is a member of the investment committee for BMW/MINI’s URBAN-X Accelerator, which invests in pre-seed companies building the future of urban living. He was named in CNN Money’s 2015 Upstart 30 and Govtech Magazine’s 2017 Top Innovators in Government. Stonly has 10 years of experience as a serial entrepreneur, building five ventures spanning different sectors and international markets, including Brazil and Canada. He has taught workshops and classes in software development and entrepreneurship and is a regular speaker at events like TechCrunch Disrupt and LAUNCH Festival.
During the quarter students will work in and out of the classroom in a four-person team to apply design thinking methods and tools to develop insights on an urban problem of choice and to develop, test, iterate, and pitch a proposed for-profit business model to address the problem (“term project”). The weekly workshop (42706) will be used to advance team projects and get feedback from classmates and instructors. A mentor from the urban entrepreneurial community will be assigned to each team for additional guidance on term projects outside the classroom throughout the quarter.
Team pitches will be presented during a specially scheduled two-hour and 40 minute workshop on Monday, March 12 (week 11) (rather than a final exam) as follows:
42706-01 Harper 10 a.m – 1p.m.
42706-02 Harper 1:30-4:30 p.m.
42706-81 Gleacher GC300 6-9 p.m.
Sections 42706-01 and 42706-02 will meet jointly at Gleacher with section 42706-81 on January 15 (Martin Luther King holiday) rather than on Monday afternoon at Harper.
The Monday evening speaker series (42707) will consist of interactive presentations by urban entrepreneurs, VCs, and municipal officials. The speaker series, workshop, weekly readings, homework exercises, and term project for 42706 / 42707 are designed to provide students with an understanding of:
o Urban challenges
o The expanding entrepreneurial role in improving city life and/or governance
o How entrepreneurs are combining and leveraging new technologies and other “enablers” to address urban challenges with innovative business models that create value for the firm and the public
o How addressing urban challenges can help resolve pressing global issues
o How design thinking methods and tools are used to develop insights into stakeholders’ problems/needs, develop products/services to meet those needs, identify and tests key assumptions, develop and employ prototypes (including, but not limited to a landing page or functioning website with bubble.io (no coding required), and iterate towards a solution
o How to embed a proposed offering in a viable business model that tackles an urban challenge in a new way
o How to identify and test key business model assumptions and assess associated risks o How to build and test a minimum viable product
o How to assess potential public benefits and market size
o How to work with local Governments (e.g. as supporters, partners, or customers)
o How to build support (e.g. early customers, advisors, corporate partners, other stakeholders)
o How to deliver an effective pitch.
The course also is designed to provide students with connections to key players in the emerging ecosystem in this dynamic space.
Who should take this class?
Students interested in entrepreneurship or corporate intrapreneurship are encouraged to consider this course. The course also may be of interest to students planning to work for municipalities or public sector practices of private consultancies and advisory firms.

He was named in CNN Money’s 2015 Upstart 30 and Govtech Magazine’s 2017 Top Innovators in Government. Stonly has 10 years of experience as a serial entrepreneur, building five ventures spanning different sectors and international markets, including Brazil and Canada. He has taught workshops and classes in software development and entrepreneurship and is a regular speaker at events like TechCrunch Disrupt and LAUNCH Festival.
During the quarter students will work in and out of the classroom in a four-person team to apply design thinking methods and tools to develop insights on an urban problem of choice and to develop, test, iterate, and pitch a proposed for-profit business model to address the problem (“term project”). The weekly workshop (42706) will be used to advance team projects and get feedback from classmates and instructors. A mentor from the urban entrepreneurial community will be assigned to each team for additional guidance on term projects outside the classroom throughout the quarter.
Team pitches will be presented during a specially scheduled two-hour and 40 minute workshop on Monday, March 12 (week 11) (rather than a final exam) as follows:
42706-01 Harper 10 a.m – 1p.m.
42706-02 Harper 1:30-4:30 p.m.
42706-81 Gleacher GC300 6-9 p.m. Sections 42706-01 and 42706-02 will meet jointly at Gleacher with section 42706-81 on January 15 (Martin Luther King holiday) rather than on Monday afternoon at Harper. The Monday evening speaker series (42707) will consist of interactive presentations by urban entrepreneurs, VCs, and municipal officials.
